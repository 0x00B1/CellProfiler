Mike's TODO list

************************************************************
Changes for CP
-On website have source for Batch processing w/out matlab plus instructions
-Add reference to Watershed

DONE:
-Install guide (windows) change font size
-Change name of programming notes
-Check on old PC if can open huge directory
-Create new help category for Batch processing
-(installation guide, programming notes, getting started, batch processing) into new category Geting Started
-Combine createclusterfiles and createbatchscripts
-Separate help for createbatchfiles module and how to run batch files
-Make WriteSQL use both Oracle and MySQL, add help rename to ExportToDatabase, also add ability to keep in one database or use existing with changing the table names from Per_Image to Experiment_Per_Image
-Add help for importing data into database

-(Anne 3-2-06) Take all the empty boxes you can find down to our storage closet.

-(Anne 3-15-06) - Some of our modules are putting out data in an inconsistent format. I think the per-cell measures are usually pretty good, but per-image measures are sometimes a little strange when I access them from the database. For example, the identifyPrim module puts something in Image Nuclei NumberOfMergedObjects Nuclei NumberOfMergedObjects (yes, it seems duplicated) relating to how many small objects were merged and that field has strange naming. Also, the measure total intensity of the whole image seemed strange. The critical thing is how subfields are made: whenever we use an underscore, CellVisualizer interprets it as a new subcategory, so we want to avoid underscores in our fieldnames.

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES
