- (Anne 6/12/06) - After you save preferences, it tells you that they are saved in the matlab root directory, which is not true for the non-developer's version of CellProfiler (see the Set Preferences window for a description of what really happens; i think it is up to date).

- Anne 6-20-06: Let's make a more informative error window that tells the user possible reasons why the image might not be found:
Question:"I have been trying to persuade CellProfiler to save images generated by tiled, but every time SaveImages complains about not being able to find the input image. I set this to be the output image of Tiled. I am running cellprofiler on MacOS 10.4.6. Am I missing something or is this a known bug ... "
Answer: "The full tiled image is only made on the final cycle, so you must set the SaveImages module to save on "Last Cycle" instead of All. That should take care of your problem!"

- (Anne 6/12/06) - LoadSingleImage seems to spit its text display into other windows, depending on what you have open and are looking at. Maybe this a fluke, transient thing but perhaps we can make it put its text in the proper window more consistently? If we fix it for this module, make sure LoadImages is also working similarly.
