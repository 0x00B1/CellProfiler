Mike's TODO list

- Culpeper Grant

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.

- (Requested by Anne) - Define grid: the row labels should be on the right (not left) and the column labels on the top (not bottom) so that the pixel locations are still visible on the left and bottom.

DONE Display grid: it looks like the labels are too far one unit to the left and one unit up.

DONE Define grid:  I think the description for MANUAL + MOUSE what is the distance? is incorrect because it says distance from control to the bottom left. In my case, I had the settings: first spot = top left, count by columns, and then MANUAL + MOUSE distance from control to the bottom left = 1,0 (spot units).  In reality, the grid was placed (as I desired) as if that question was asking 'MANUAL + MOUSE distance from control to the *top left*'. So I think we need to change the text to read either 'top left' or maybe 'the first spot' (in other words, as defined by your settings for 'first spot'). Ideally, it would be first spot. I am just not sure how the code actually works.
