Mike's TODO list

Anne 12/21 - answer the form factor question i emailed you.

Anne 12/21 - Could you run every module we have (well, ok, as many as you can stand) and make sure that the table of measures is complete? Many non "Measure" modules actually put stuff in the handles.Measurements so I want to be sure I covered everything.

Anne 12/21 - need the list of modules w/short descriptions to be in their categories.

Anne 12/21 - I cannot remember if this is resolved... please let me know what the status is and if it changes the description in the module help (and therefore the description in the paper).

Hi Anne!

The Zernike moments are not that straightforward to use or interpret. They
describe more the shape of an object than just the border of the object.
Perhaps Fig. 2 in "Automated Recognition of Patterns Characteristic of
Subcellular Structures in Fluorescence Microscopy Images" by Boland et al
can give you some hint of how they work.

I'm not really happy with the current Zernike implementation in
CellProfiler (or how the Zernike measurements are used by Boland et al.).
The reason is the following line in the MeasureShape module:

diameter = floor(sqrt(4/pi*mean(cat(1,props.Area)))+1);

which fixes the diameter a disc/circular area (the so-called Zernike
polynomials are only defined on a 2D disc) within which the measurement is
made. If an object is bigger or smaller than the disc the measurement will
not be good (Fig. 2 in Boland et al. shows an example where the object are
smaller than the disc). This means that, for example, the area of the
objects/cells is a confounding factor in the Zernike measurements. I would
therefore be careful when reporting the Zernike measurements. I would
first
check if they correlate well with some other measurement, such as the size
of the objects.

To get a higher quality Zernike features, the diameter above should be
adapted to each object. This means that the following code

% Calculate the Zernike basis functions
[x,y] = meshgrid(linspace(-1,1,diameter),linspace(-1,1,diameter));
r = sqrt(x.^2+y.^2);
phi = atan(y./(x+eps));
Zf = zeros(size(x,1),size(x,2),size(Zernikeindex,1));
for k = 1:size(Zernikeindex,1)
    n = Zernikeindex(k,1);
    m = Zernikeindex(k,2);
    s = zeros(size(x));
    for l = 0:(n-m)/2;
         s  = s + (-1)^l*fak(n-l)/( fak(l) * fak((n+m)/2-l) *
fak((n-m)/2-l)) * r.^(n-2*l).*exp(sqrt(-1)*m*phi);
    end
    s(r>1) = 0;
    Zf(:,:,k) = s;
end

has to be moved inside the loop a few lines further down

for Object = 1:NumObjects
....
end

and the diameter variable set so that the object fits within a circle of
that diameter (perhaps you can use the major axis measurement to decide a
suitable diameter size). Then the Zernike measurements would give
size-invariant shape features. It will take some more time to compute the
features, but I would recommend that you do this.

Unfortunately, this will not help you with an interpretation. The first
papers on Zernike moments for shape measurements
appear to be the following:

A. Khotanzad and Y. H. Hong
"Rotation invariant pattern recognition using Zernike moments," in Proc.
9th ICPR Rome, Italy, Nov. 1988, pp. 326-328

Khotanzad A, Hong YH: Invariant image recognition by Zernike
moments. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Machine Intell 12:489Ð497, 1990

Perhaps you can find some more information on the interpretation in the
latter paper.

Well, I hope this answer is more useful than confusing!

Best regards,
Ola

Anne 12/19 Yeast SCMD images - process and produce nice figure.

- Anne 12/16 - Put folders for all of your projects so far on sabatini3_ata (our new server). These all should have the same format 2005_12_16_ProjectName so we can keep things straight. I will move my projects there too. I'd move everything from the local computers (G5's and PC) there and put them in a folder for deletion on the desktop of those computers and when we are sure that server is being backed up we can delete the local copies. This will allow us to easily share data, keep projects straight, work on our projects from any of our computers, and have the data backed up (the G5's and PC are not backed up so if they die all your data is gone!).

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the Compile wizard instructions are up to date now.

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the instructions for uploading the cp website to jura are up to date now.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- For some reason the HelpProgrammingNotes do not scroll properly in the text display box - there is no way to scroll in small enough increments to see all the text. I think this is our longest text file so maybe that's why it behaves strangely.

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.
