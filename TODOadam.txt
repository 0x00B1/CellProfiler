CELLVISUALIZER/DATA MINING PROJECTS:

- Anne 11-16-06: Add features/statistics to CellVisualizer that allow answering gene-centric questions like "Is my gene unusual in any of its measured features?" and "what genes look like my favorite gene?" (this is a clustering question). This is part of a grand project: We could present a searchable database for people to find out 'what's weird about my gene' as a public resource.  This short blurb describes this sort of a resource:

We are very close to having our own database done; it simply involves:
1. Developing the few missing tools in CellVisualizer that are 'gene-centric' - figuring out the statistics is the key thing, so people have confidence in whether their gene really is an outlier or not for each feature.
2. Possibly processing a larger set than just 1000 genes. Novartis probably has a full set that we might be able to use.
3. Coming up with a few convincing examples.

- Improve normalization procedures for array data so they are easier for people to do themselves (build into CellVisualizer)

- According to literature, ploidy (DNA content) is tightly linked to cell size. Is this true across G1, S, G2 phases of the cell cycle?  Look for gene knockdowns which break the correlation: e.g., where 4c cells are not as tightly 2x the size as 2c, to find genes involved in the maintenance of a tight correlation between cell size and genome size.


CLUSTERING PROJECTS:

- Try clustering (Arcady'd5s and standard) on Fly200 data and on NIRHT data.

- NEW - Try clustering individual cells based on their measured phenotypes, and create some montages of the most distinct/unusual cell 'families' that are found, so we can see whether this might be a good approach.

- Do ribosomal components cluster into classes, or are they really all the same?

ON GOING:

-Help lab members in mining their data from screens.

-Continue to develop CellVisualizer
