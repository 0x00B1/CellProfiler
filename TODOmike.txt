Mike's TODO list

- Anne(1-12-07) - MeasureImageGranularity does not seem to be storing anything in 'Features' and it messed up ExportToDatabase in peculiar ways (no column headers and extra data). Please see if you can fix it.

- Add ObjectCount to handles.Measurements?

- As we discovered, Plate fix in the Crop module works to force the coordinates to be used each time freshly (when doing rectangle, coordinates). Can you describe in the help why/how this works? I guess in my case none of the rows/columns were 50% empty, so the real purpose of Plate fix was thwarted, while the cute side benefit of repeating use of the coordinates was used?

- Score widerborst images blindly, then tabulate the data and draw conclusions - do new dsRNAs work? Did old ones repeat?

- Merck screens (image acquisition and analysis only)

- Culpeper mouse arrays
