Near-term:

   Verify that illumination correction keeps values in 0-1.

   * Describe how to set up cluster jobs in the manual [BETA]
  
   * Write propagate paper :)

   * Have local CP code copied to the cluster ??  Or should batch
     files check versions when they run?

   Batch merging should produce partial results

   Batch merge help file

Long-term:

Chat with John Fisher about finding subpopulations using lower
dimensional space.

Improving/understanding illumination correction and adaptive
thresholding (division/rescaling). (For now, use DivideAll Mean.)
Especially, fix Adaptive thresholding D5 (wasn't sure what kind of
thresholding to allow). Can we make the nuc. Distance module use
adaptive thresholding, or is it equivalent to using an "each"
corr. Illum or adapthisteq? Improve segmentation between background
and cell edges: propagate uses a simple threshold, and watershed uses
watershed.  Could maybe use adaptive threshold. Which is better? 

Improve cell segmentation. Can we/do we want to  make the propagate
function have a user-specified neighborhood size?

Make all modules parameter-free :)

Texture measurement

Implement a trous wavelet segmentation algorithm from a paper Anne found (?)

Think about porting to python

Look at Matlab central to see if any of these are useful/faster than
what we have: auto image registration using mutual information (x2),
Graph analysis toolbox, multivariate analysis multispectral
