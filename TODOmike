\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mike's TODO list\
\
- (Requested by Anne 8-23-05) - Go through the code looking for instances of the term "image set" and replace with "cycle" where appropriate.\
\
- When loading a module whose variable revision number has changed, many of the variables come up as blank in the window where you choose between Saved and Default.\
\
NOTE FOR THE ABOVE BUGS: There is a line marked FIXME in CellProfiler.m that might explain some of these issues.\
\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - Maybe make new pipelines to show off different features of CellProfiler if desired (e.g. the SpotIdentifier or yeast colony finding). [Anne recently did yeast colony finding and human nuclei - we can spruce these up just prior to release, so maybe put this back on the general TODO towards the bottom where we have "Pre-release" stuff to do.\
