CELLVISUALIZER/DATA MINING PROJECTS:

- Anne 7-14-06 - Use CellVisualizer to poke around for samples with unusual measurement values, to find new phenotypes to train classifiers and identify genes in the human NIRHT data. \

- Anne 7-14-06 - In NIRHT, using CellVisualizer, look up our favorite control genes and report on their cell size, cell cycle (DNA content), and cell count:
mTOR, S6K, Rheb, PTEN, Akt1. Ideally, some sense of significance values would be nice, but perhaps a visual check would be ok. What to use for controls? Perhaps shLuc + GFP + PGW + EMPTY on the same plate? We probably don't want to compare across plates, because Ray is afraid there are some serious variations.

- Improve normalization procedures for array data.

- According to literature, ploidy (DNA content) is tightly linked to cell size. Is this true across G1, S, G2 phases of the cell cycle?  Look for gene knockdowns which break the correlation: e.g., where 4c cells are not as tightly 2x the size as 2c, to find genes involved in the maintenance of a tight correlation between cell size and genome size.


CLUSTERING PROJECTS:

- Try clustering (Arcady'd5s and standard) on Fly200 data and on NIRHT data.

- NEW - Try clustering individual cells based on their measured phenotypes, and create some montages of the most distinct/unusual cell 'families' that are found, so we can see whether this might be a good approach.

- Do ribosomal components cluster into classes, or are they really all the same?

ON GOING:

-Help lab members in mining their data from screens.

-Continue to develope CellVisualizer
