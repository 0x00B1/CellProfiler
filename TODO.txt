CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 


Mike 8-7-06: If you filter then classify objects on subset and no cells present in second bin, first bin gets total object count not "filtered" object count

Anne 7-11-06: We should check through the existing error messages in modules, and allow the user a way out if possible. For example, a lot of times a module will error out and cancel processing and say something like "your values were outside the range 0 to 1". Most likely, in that case you would provide a warning dialog that says "You entered a value of -0.5 which is below the minimum value of 0, so the value 0 will be used. Change settings to prevent this error in the future." Make sure that the window doesn't pop up fresh every cycle!

- Rodrigo 7/24/06: We should prevent CellProfiler from opening again if its already open. Some of it functions stop working when this happens. It seems this was corrected before (10/05), but for some reason it's not working.

- Anne 7-20-06: Catch potential problems in the LoadImages module - right now if the user uses the same image name to call their loaded images, they will overwrite each other of course. So, if they put a couple of LoadImages modules in at various points in the pipeline and each time, for example, call the image "OrigBlue" (because they don't care if the one loaded earlier is overwritten at that point in the pipeline), everything will work OK the first time through the pipeline, but the 2nd time through, the last OrigBlue's FileList will be the only one present, so all the LoadImages modules will load those images. Ask Mike or Anne for details.

THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY ON THE TODOurops list, which I've now deleted: - Mike - Stacked tifs

- Anne 6-30-06: Find Edges, MaskImage, CalculateMath, Combine module need documentation and help. Check all the data tools, image tools, and modules to see that there is at least some documentation - sometimes we copy a new module from an old one, so there might be help there, BUT it's from the OLD MODULE! In these cases, we should delete the help and say "Sorry, this module is undocumented." but then document it ASAP!

- Anne 6-21-06: try using MATLAB's function memmapfile to use memory mapping when loading really large images to see if it helps relieve 'out of memory' issues. We have super-large 5x scans of entire slides to use in this testing. If this works well, we should have "run in memory mapping mode for large images?" as a preference in Set Preferences, and then we would adjust the CPretrieveimage subfunction (or whatever it's called) to check whether we are in memory mapping mode or not in order to decide how to retrieve images. It's unclear to me whether this would involve a ridiculous amount of change - for example, would we have to change every module that stores an image in the handles to store it in a particular special way?

- (Anne 6/12/06) - Do we have developer's instructions somewhere that warn about code changes that will also require changes in your compiling process (using MATLAB editors especially)? It would be good if Anne and the summer students are more aware of them so things don't crash and burn!

- (Anne 5/26/06) - Make "subobject" data exportable - I am pretty sure right now we cannot get individual speckle data out, for example? Also, exporting the identity of neighbors I think is not currently possible.

- (Anne 5/25/06) - What are our latest stats for # downloads, interesting institutions/companies, mac vs pc, etc.

- (Anne 5/10/06) - When analyzing images in CellProfiler, after every cycle should we check to see what images are used downstream (checking all the imagegroup members) and strip the rest out? This would save a lot of memory.

- (Anne 4/25/06) - The inability to nicely scroll the help windows is pretty annoying on the mac platform. Why can't we resize the window? Maybe there is a good reason.

- (Anne 3-21-06) - In the installation instructions, one of the first things you are supposed to do is Set Preferences -> Modules. I just wanted to doublecheck that this step has to be done - there is no way we can at least attempt to figure it out?

- (Requested by Colin 3/20) - I think if you change a indep infotype and then click on another module before clicking anywhere else, it doesn't actually add the new infotype.

- (Anne 2-9-06) Usually I name (in an IdentifyPrimAutomatic module) the outlines so they can later be overlaid on an image. When I type in the name in IdentifyPrimAutomatic and then go to the OverlayOutlines module, the new outlines name is not selectable. If I go back and click on the outlines name again and press enter and then go back to OverlayOutlines, it finally shows up. So it seems like some sort of little bug.

- (Requested by Anne 2-24-06) - I just fixed a bug in LoadImages where if the user typed in 'automatic' in lower case for the two variables (blur and neighborhood suppression) it failed and gave an inexplicable error message. All I had to do was change the strcmp to strcmpi to make it case-insensitive. I think that this is probably a common thing we overlooked. We should go through the code and look for all strcmp and strncmp and replace with the case-insensitive versions strcmpi and strncmpi where appropriate. We don't want to just find and replace all of them because occasionally it might be necessary to be case sensitive! The tool in Matlab Edit > Find Files should be helpful to find all the instances of strcmp in the m files.

- (Requested by Anne 12-16-05)- Design an informational brochure

- (Requested by Anne 12-15-05)- Should we somehow refresh memory after every cycle of CP? It gets slower and slower with each cycle which can be fixed by using Restart module, so something must be up with the memory handling. See matlab's pack function, perhaps.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- The Manual Compiler chokes on the images for CorrectIllumination_Apply and _Calculate due to the underscore in their names - need to fix.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- We want the manual compiler to generate a page towards the beginning with all the short descriptions from each module and tool as a Quick Reference Guide.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Make preferences work a bit better when having more than one copy of CP on a computer. E.g. if I start CP in my own copy of trunk/CellProfiler, it reads that previously I set the modules folder to someone else's trunk/CellProfiler, so it adds *their* Modules folder to the top of my path. In fact, perhaps we should not have the Modules folder be stored in the pref's anyway - it should just always be the Modules folder within the currently running CellProfiler!!

- Check Matlab Central for useful code to incorporate into CellProfiler or its modules (last checked on 9-16-04: Biotech/medical, Graphics (all 3 categories), Image Processing, Utilities, GUI Tools & examples, and Misc.

- (requested by Anne 12-13-05) - If we use xlsread anywhere, apparently we can now use it for mac and pc: Service Request ID: 1-QXCUJ: reported on September 15,2004 regarding MATLAB 7.0 (R14):  Why does XLSREAD on Mac OS X produce different results than on Windows in MATLAB?
http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-QXCVA.html?ref=ts_r14sp3

- (requested by Anne 12-13-05) - If we use propedit anywhere, apparently we can now use it for mac and pc: Service Request ID: 1-RR6M1: reported on September 29,2004 regarding MATLAB 7.0 (R14): Why do I receive an error when I use the PROPEDIT function in MATLAB 7.0 (R14)?
http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-RWDNU.html?ref=ts_r14sp3

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Make a data tool for normalization - see the help in Data Layout for starters and talk to Adam. We will probably put this tool in CellVisualizer instead.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)- Many modules do not have corresponding images in the manual, so we should make some example images in Promotional/ImagesForManual.

- (Requested by Anne 11-21-05) - Calculations shouldnt be made if they don't need to be (outlines, colored label matrix for display)

- Improve speed of ordfilt2 used by CPsmooth (takes forever). Look into getting new code at mathworks website or anywhere else. Something that does the same thing.

- (Requested by Anne 11-28-05) - Make the expand or shrink module work well with shrinking secondary objects.

-(Mike 11/14 I think this can be done with invisible plot but i couldnt get it to work) (Requested by Anne) - Define grid: the row labels should be on the right (not left) and the column labels on the top (not bottom) so that the pixel locations are still visible on the left and bottom.

- (Requested by Colin) NOT SURE IF THIS IS PRACTICAL - The measure modules create an error when a label matrix with an object completely missing is given to it.  We took care of this by making Identify modules create a single pixel if an object is missing.  It would be nice to allow objects to be missing in measurement modules.  Also, once the measurement modules are working, make sure it is possible to export the data to excel.


THINGS TO DO WHEN NEW VERSIONS OF MATLAB COME OUT:
---------------------------------------------------
- update the image file formats that are readable in LoadImages modules and saveable in SaveImages module and SaveImageAs Image tool, and anywhere else needed. Searching for 'DIB' is a good way to find image-reading code.

- update the colormaps available.

- For many functions we have made our own CP versions - check the new matlab code to see if they've changed anything that would warrant us re-creating the CP subfunctions to use the new code. This would require saving a copy of the old matlab code to do side by side comparison (actually, could use 'file comparison' tool in matlab, I think, or at least in microsoft word).


PROJECTS, MOSTLY VISION/IMAGE ANALYSIS-RELATED:
-----------------------------------------------
+++ (Requested by Anne: WOULD BE *REALLY* HELPFUL FOR OUR WORM PROJECTS, WHICH START IN AUGUST!) - Implement the matlab algorithms described here for identifying c elegans in images: Cronin, Mendel, et al BMC Genetics 2005  www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/5

++ (Anne 5/10/06) - IMPORTANT - The propagate algorithm works very nicely in our IdSec module. We should add this as an option for the IdPrimAutomatic module (It would be a new method for finding the dividing lines between clumped objects, along with Intensity and Distance.)

++ (Requested by Anne 1-17-06) - We should make a new module to calculate the KS statistic for every image set. It would require notifying the software which images are controls (they can load this information using LoadText, as is done for the CalculateStatistics module), because this statistic compares the distribution of individual cell measures from each image to the distribution of individual cell measures from the control image(s). Once finished, we should see whether the calculated KS statistic produces a better Z' score than the 'percent above threshold' method for the BioImage cyto-nuc translocation assay. References: Chakravart LaR: Handbook of methods of applied statistics. Vol 1New york: John wiley, 1967:392-394; also Giuliano, Chen, Taylor, J Biomol Screening 2004; 9:557-568. See also Wilson, Si, Thompson, Smellie, Ashwell et al, J Biomol Screen 2005 or 2006 "Identification of a small molecule that induces mitotic arrest using s simplified high-content screening assay and data analysis method." because this has an example where KS statistics are calculated between several control images and this value is subtracted from the KS values for each image. Also, Smellie J Chem Inf Model 2005 or 2006.

++ (Requested by Anne) - right now we choose between intensity and shape (or distance) at two places in IdentifyPrimAutomatic. It might be cool to develop a more sophisticated method that allows you to balance the input of these two sources of information.

+ (Anne 5/12/06) - Add more shape measures to MeasureObjectAreaShape. The Image processing handbook has some described starting on page 513 and the Shape analysis and classification book has some starting on page 422. See also articles that Anne has: {Rodenacker, 2003 A feature set for cytometry on digitized microscopic images}{Boland, 2001 #A neural network classifier capable of recognizing the patterns of all major subcellular structures in fluorescence microscope images of HeLa cells}  Another useful feature: # of invaginations of the perimeter.  Also investigate Tchebyshev orthogonal moments, which are supposedly described in an article currently in press at Pattern Recognition, by Bartek (short for a longer name) Rajwa in Robinson's lab at Purdue. I requested the article from him May 22. How about Fourier measures of shape? Is that a good idea?
See also comments from Ray:
Hi Ray,
I just heard a talk about measuring shape in images, and the speaker
compared three inputs: the binary object, a polygon (explicit curve)
and an implicit curve (something about modeling it as a 3D curve that
crosses a plane at a certain level). THey found that the binary, due to
quantization, was particularly bad at capturing shape properties. - this
may be what jeff price was talking about when he thought that we might
be seeing a correlation of some zernikes with size. Is this an area we
ought to improve?
-a
Actually, I doubt Matlab does much more than the usual quantization
approach, but we can check.  It's probably slower to do anything with
curves or implicit curves, which would probably need to loop over
objects.  The binary masks can use the faster matrix/vector
operations. What might make sense for the Zernike and other shape measures is to
do some experiments with large shapes and progressively smaller
versions created by downsampling.  Then we can get an idea how much
those shapes vary as the resolution drops, and we might be able to
estimate ranges for those measurements, rather than just a single
estimate with no indication of its accuracy. - Ray

+ (Anne 5/20/06) - Is it possible to have our shape/texture measures match up with those used my Robert Murphy's lab at Carnegie Mellon? I think already our Haralick texture features are nicely categorized using his nomenclature but it's worth checking our other measures to be sure that they are proper categories with the proper SLF numbers.

+++ (Requested by Anne 11-02-05) - The paper Ortiz de Solorzano, Malladi, Lockett, J Microscopy 2001 has what looks like a really nice segmentation method. I think that the only problem is that it is slow, which they were planning to address in future work. It would be nice to contact the authors to see if they have any new algorithms and implement them into CP.

+++ (Requested by Anne 11-02-05) - The paper Malladi & Sethian PNAS 1995 has what looks like a really nice filter that makes objects more obvious in images with lots of noise.   It would be nice to contact the authors to see if they have any new algorithms and implement them into CP.

+++ (Requested by Anne 9-19-05) - For cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation, implement Ilya Ravkin's technique where instead of having a binary mask that denotes nucleus vs cytoplasm, there is a weighted function that is based on the nuclear stain. The Univ. Delft people have done similar work in this area.

+++ (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - http://wiki.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/Main_Page has open source algorithms we could implement.

+++ Write algorithms to compare hand-traced results to CellProfiler results quantitatively, then apply them to our hand-traced data sets. [2 parts: 1) segment manual images.  2) match object to object, 3) signed distance transfer]

+++ Allow batches of different settings to be run and their results compared 

+++ Allow automatic selection of settings based on hand-traced images

+++ Make separate Identify Secondary modules: one for bright lines and one for dark lines between objects.  Also try watershedding the gradient image rather than the original. 

+ (Requested by Anne 10-13-05) - There is a fairly simple routine in Janssens, et al., Dev Genes Evol 2005 (215:374-381) for drosophila cells in embryos. It might be fun to implement this routine into a CP pipeline.

+++ (Requested by Anne 8-23-05) - Try to get yeast identification working for phase contrast images - we set up something for SErge Pelet, but haven't really gone at this application in a systematic way - a lot of people want this and I think it's doable but we just haven't put in the effort. IdentifyPrimYeastPhase was one attempt, but it's very empirical and not very adjustable for other images. In fact, it doesn't even work well at the moment for the original images, from Ben 03_25_2005.  Check into the literature for better methods or try to get that method working. Not sure if these references are for fluorescence or phase images: SCMD: Saccharomyces cerevisiae Morphological Database. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan 1;32 Database issue:D319-22. PMID: 14681423. Perhaps more promising is the paper Coelho, M, Ferreira et al, Applied Microbial and Cell Physiol, 2004, where they mention having Matlab code to accomplish yeast cell segmentation (Anne has this paper).

+++  (Requested by Anne) - Implement the algorithm for in vitro angiogenesis from  IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2005 Apr;24(4):549-53. Robust quantification of in vitro angiogenesis through image analysis. Niemisto A, Dunmire V, Yli-Harja O, Zhang W, Shmulevich I

+++  (Requested by Anne) - Implement the algorithm for migration analysis from Qin J, Chittenden TW, Gao L, Pearlman JD.	 Automated migration analysis based on cell texture: method & reliability. BMC Cell Biol. 2005 Mar 3;6(1):9. 

+++ (Anne 4-21-06)  Implement the algorithm from Shen, Nelson, Kennedy et al: Automatic tracking of biological cells and compartments using particle filters and active contours, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, in press. At least try implementing the object-identification algorithm into IdentifyPrimAutomatic, but perhaps do the kinetic (time-lapse) part too.

+++ (Requested by Anne 2-14-06) -  Implement the algorithm from: IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed. 2006 Jan;10(1):5-10. A new detection algorithm (NDA) based on fuzzy cellular neural networks for white blood cell detection.  Shitong W, Min W.

+++ (Requested by Anne 9-28-05) - Build some kind of module that allows interfacing with ImageJ so that routines built for ImageJ (open-source, written in Java) can be run in CellProfiler??  In other words, CellProfiler would use ImageJ as a backend. No idea how complicated this would be. See practice ImageJ integration ideas below (two of them):
* Simplest: Add a nice alignment (image registration) algorithm from ImageJ that can be found at: http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms.html, which is referenced in Sage IEEE 2005 as one of the best. Make sure it isn't the same as the algorithm we already have in Align.m!
* Implement the algorithm for identifying objects based on granulometry from Prodanov, Heeroma, and Marani, J Neuroscience Methods 2005. The code may be available from the authors directly, or supplemental journal data, or from ImageJ.
* If we want to extend CP to analyze 3D images, there is a good example available here: Gue, Messaoudi, Sun, Boudier Cytometry 2005 on Smart 3D-FISH. It's available as an imageJ plug in.

+++ (Requested by Anne) - Make modules to identify objects in transmitted light/DIC images. Potentially useful references: Heise, Sonnleitner, Klement, Microsc Research & Technique 66:312-320 (2005).  This paper looks like it has a few options for ways to pre-process DIC images to end up with images that look more like fluorescence images which can then be processed using our normal Identify algorithms. This one might also help: Kam, Bioimaging 1998 on line integration and deconvolution of DIC images which would be a cool filter to implement that might allow people to analyze DIC images.

++ (Requested by Anne) - Align/resize a stack of images (like yeast plates). See Matlab demo on image registration.

+++ (Requested by Anne) - Implement Neurite tracing algorithm: see potentially useful references, which Anne has: 
* J Neurosci Methods. 2005 Sep 17; Automated identification of axonal growth cones in time-lapse image sequences. Keenan TM, Hooker A, Spilker ME, Li N, Boggy GJ, Vicini P, Folch A.  
* Weaver_NeuralComput_2004.pdf
* Weaver_JNeuroMeth_2003.pdf. 
* See also Anne's emails from Weaver and Brent Lindquist and John Pinezich.
* Xiong Cytometry 2006 might be the best; C++ code available from authors.

+++ (Requested by Anne) - Particle tracking over time module. At the very least, (Ray 7-6-06), we should perhaps implement something as simple as "assign nuclei in image B the same label as the closest nucleus in image A," with some magic for splitting/merging when necessary. Good references:
1 - Sbalzarini Koumoutsakos J Struct Biol 151 (2005) p 182 has fairly complicated free code in C, although a license of some sort is required.  Also, in there there is a reference to Cheezum BioPhys J 2001, 81, 2378-2388 having several algorithms implemented and compared.
2- Debeir,  Decaestacker IEEE TRans. Medical Imaging vol 24 no 6 June 2005. I don't really understand the algorithm in this one.
3- Miura Adv Biochem Engin/Biotech 2005 95:267-295 is a nice overview.
4- See also Niven, Fuks, J MIcrobiol Methods 2005 where they feed XY locations into a program they wrote called ObjectTracker, which might be helpful.

++ (Requested by Anne) - Implement the cubic B-spline illumination correction method in Wahlby, Anal Cell Pathol 2002 p. 101. Its use is described in Xiong Cytometry 2006 (Anne has these articles in pdf format), and their source code (in C++) is available upon request. This seems like it would fit very nicely as another method (the variable where we normally choose Fit polynomial, or smooth by a particular artifact width).

+++ (Requested by Anne) - New algorithm to calculate colocalization. Ask Ray if it seems like a good idea. One part of the paper is simply describing the concept of masking the image for the region of interest (ROI) prior to calculating the correlation coefficient, which we already do. But the second part is a different calculation which may be superior to the one we use, but not sure: Jaskolski, Mulle, Manzoni J Neurosci Methods 146(2005) 42-49. The matlab code is apparently available from the authors.

++ (Requested by Anne 11-01-05) - There are many ways to measure the best focus of an image. Right now our MeasureSaturationBlur module has only one of these methods. Implement many of the focus methods in this paper, and have the 'best'/fastest one be the default: Sun, Duthaler, Nelson, Microscopy Research & Technique 2004 (Anne has the pdf of this).

+++ (Requested by Anne) - RAY PROBABLY HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED THIS WITH BELIEF PROPAGATION: Improve foreground/background determination, i.e. automatic thresholding, i.e. background/cell edge finding. Right now, thresholding is a real problem for us. Ask Ray for advice. 
IDEA 1:
Make the background correction based on Each image (rather than All images) a little more sophisticated as follows: Cell segmentation and llumination correction can be made simultaneously for best result.  The usual procedure is as follows (the technique is called Expectation Maximization segmentation):
* Segment cells
* Estimate illumination variation from the background and correct the original image
* Re-segment cells
* Re-estimate illumination variation from the background and correct the original image
* Re-segment cells
* Repeat until convergence.
* The iterations can be performed on a low-resolution version of the original image, e.g. 200x200 pixels, so I don't think it's time-consuming.  This will involve figuring out how to call a downstream Identify module to use the settings and code from the downstream module (otherwise we'd have to build background subtraction into every identify module). 
IDEA 2:
This paper has many thresholding functions implemented. We could add many of them to CP, or at least the best one: Rajagopalan, Lu, Yaszemski, Robb, J Biomed Mater Res 2005. When finished, we should compare to current results and see if it improves things. 
IDEA 3:
Implement Jeff Price's FIR filter idea? (Price, Hunter, Gough Cytometry 1996), although we need to mark with a disclaimer that it's for academic purposes only because for commercial use, it's patented, and also Jeff says it does not deal with clumpy objects, so I guess it's for thresholding only, it is not a complete segmentation solution. 
IDEA 4:
(anne has a copy): {Sezgin, 2004 #Survey over image thresholding techniques and quantitative performance evaluation, Journal of Electronic Imaging} See also Ridler-Calvard thresholding: I heard about it at a meeting in relation to Otsu's method and it's unclear whether it has any advantages.

+++ (Requested by Anne 9-14-05) ASK RAY IF THIS IS A USEFUL THING - Implement Bob Murphy's classification algorithms into CP?  These algorithms compare images of protein localization and can tell you which compartment a protein is localized in.  See Chen, Murphy, J Biomed/Biotech 2005 87-95.

+++ (Requested by Anne) - Reproduce the major 'big pharma' screening assays: (from Bowen and Wylie, Assay & DrugDvpmnt Tech 2006) PROBABLY WE CAN DO MOST OF THESE ALREADY - WAIT UNTIL A PARTICULAR APPLICATION IS NEEDED>>>
cell adhesion
Neurite outgrowth
micronucleus formation
protein translocation
cell cycle analysis
cell colony formation
cell differentiation
adipogenesis
reporter gene analysis
cell viability
cell spreading
cell proliferation
apoptosis
microtubule formation
receptor trafficking
protein kinase activation
mitotic index
proteasome activity
oligosaccharide synthesis
cell migration
membrane potential
gap junction formation
p-glycoprotein activity
angiogenesis

+++  (Requested by Anne) SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A PRACTICAL USE FOR IT!! - Make a user-scoring module that allows the user to view and annotate each image manually. Show control side by side (1-4 at a time) and add that assessment to the data structure. Maybe allow randomizing (to do blind tests). Allow clicking through. Could also be used just for viewing images (e.g. every third image in a gigantic image set).  Whether the file name and/or sample info is shown should be optional. 

+++  (Requested by Anne) - Allow data to be exported to Open Microscopy Environment databases.  (WAIT ON THIS - Being worked on by Tony Scelfo in Peter Sorger's lab).
