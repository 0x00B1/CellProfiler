Mike's TODO list

[I guess Colin is working on this>>>]: Mike, it would be nice to allow Matlab to export a transparent image of gridlines and (separately) gene names to help us navigate the low-res scanned genome-wide arrays. Ideally, we would use the 'display grid info' module in CellProfiler, but since Matlab can't handle the huge high res images, it would be nice to allow CP to make a grid and export the grid (and gene names) to an image file which we could then open in photoshop and paste into a new channel over the original image. This is a frequent issue, when we want to poke around by eye on the low res scanned image but we can't get our bearings for what gene is where.

Figure 5:  Anne 1-26-06: Process 2nd BioImage CNT image set, from Arne.

Figure 1: DONE! except change the y axes to be identical in 1D.

Figure 2D (G2/M separation)
- For part 2 we hope we Will use jason's suggested mutant and see if we can see an increase in metaphase nuclei. {UPDATE: We have already done a full phenotypic analysis of jason's image set - In Han is setting up CV to access this data and then we can go into the database and look for high p-H3 staining + small nuclei + eccentric nuclei and look for hits and then check the original images to see if they look metaphase arrested.}
[PICK SOMETHING FROM THE NIRHT_4N_nucsize hit list that looks like it has a lot of metaphase nuclei. TEMP COPY of these images are on CP_G5 so you can choose a nice one. We might need to use shape (eccentricity) too - not just nuc size and 4N content. We wrote out two options for displaying - not sure which will be nicer.] [[UPDATE 1-26-06: I think now you have that spot number we found when looking with Ray and that is the image you want to use for this, right?]]

Figure 2I (kiger hits quantified)
- We need to figure out if it will be feasible to find neat Kiger examples. We can use images from our kc genome-wide screen (or her original images).
[[[RAY IS SORT OF WORKING ON THIS, SO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE COMES UP WITH]]]

Figure 3A (DNA content histograms)
Anne 1-26-06: We are abandoning S2R+ cells, so just show example images for the human cells as noted on the figure, with outlines on top, esp. for a crowded part of an image. 

Post all the example images and pipelines at cellprofiler.org

Anne 1-26-06: Give me the sources (names of people, institutions, web address, experimental details - whatever we have) of all the image files used in the paper (outside our own lab). Giving it to me all at once, in email form would probably be easiest.

****** END OF MANUSCRIPT PROJECTS ******

When the manuscript is submitted, *please* move *everything* you've ever processed on the G5's and your PC to its own, dated experiment folder on sabatini3_ata, within a Figure folder if appropriate.

FIGURE OUT WHY NUMBERS ARE WEIRD FOR PHOSPHO HISTONE 3 DATA IN DATABASE - e.g. why isn't pH3 staining within the nucleus???

Note: sample 48 = String, sample 340 = CyclinA

Anne 1/17: I think you mentioned wanting to make MergeBatchOutput a data tool rather than a module so that we fix the time elapsed problems that were preventing exporting. Also, MergeBatchOutput produces an output file that has lost its real pipeline - the pipeline is just the MergeBatchOutput module. It should take the Pipeline and settings from the Batch_data.mat (first image set's output file).

Anne 12/23: I noticed something peculiar in the movie I am analyzing - several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance. Can you check whether this is true for other images, and if it's a bug? [Anne asked Ola 1/9/06]

Anne 1/5: Playing with Jason's human images: the data is already processed through CellProfiler, but we have to fix a few images... some of the puro
+ (which is supposed to kill uninfected cells) identified
hundreds of nuclei instead of zero (bad thresholding).  We need to go
back in and fix this at some point.  I think the spots where it
happened are obvious: they have a very low threshold.

- Anne 1-18 - David Approved ~ $4 k to buy/build a computer. Go ahead and put a price list together and show it to me so i can approve it and we can buy it! If we need more money, we can scrape it from other grants, so just figure out what will be really useful/valuable and not absurdly expensive.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES
