Mike's TODO list

- (Requested by Anne) - It would be nice if the Crop module would allow you to freehand draw a rectangle (rather than an ellipse) on each image as it cycles through. ANNE SAYS - I think we can already do this, by clicking points at the corners of the rectangle.

- (Requested by Anne 9-22-05) - To be consistent with the other modules, I think we should change the MeasureImageSaturationBlur fieldnames a bit. Right now, it looks like this:
> handles.Measurements.Image
ans = 
           FocusScoreFeatures: {'FocusScore OrigGreen'}
                   FocusScore: {[0.1509]  [0.0999]  [0.1208]}
    PercentSaturationFeatures: {'PercentSaturation OrigGreen'}
            PercentSaturation: {[0]  [0]  [0]}

I think instead it should be SaturationBlur_OrigGreen and SaturationBlur_OrigGreenFeatures, and then the feature names would be BlurScore (not FocusScore) and PercentSaturated (not PercentSaturation). As it currently is, subsequent modules would overwrite the results here, because there is no image-specific thing added to the main field name.  Making these changes should also render this module compatible with the MeasureRatios module, too, so we should then adjust the MeasureRatios module so you can choose these measures.

- (Requested by Anne) - Adapt MeasureAreaOccupied to use the same threshold options as are in IdentifyPrimAutomatic.  Also, its measurements are not saved in the proper structure format. It looks like this when I analyzed three image cycles:
handles.Measurements
ans = 
             ImageAreaOccupiedStainedRegion: {[156845]  [424211]  [336473]}
    ImageAreaOccupiedThresholdStainedRegion: {[0.0174]  [0.0406]  [0.0290]}
But these measurements should actually be in handles.Measurements.Image in two separate fields - one with the measurements and the other with the feature names, and with these two fields listed above being features.  This should make the module compatible with the MeasureRatios module, so we should then adjust the MeasureRatios module so you can choose these measures.

- (Requested by Anne 8-24-05) - The SaveImageAs ImageTool gave this error when I tried to use it on a IdentifyPrimAutomatic figure window that was saved as a matlab fig file and then reopened later:
??? Invalid handle object.
Error in ==> SaveImageAs at 29
    MainWinPos = get(handles.figure1,'Position');
??? Error while evaluating uimenu Callback.

- (Requested by Anne) - Add a happy dialog box that shows while CellProfiler is loading.  Include the CellProfiler logo, 'CellProfiler is starting up...' text, the authors & contributors, etc.

- Add 'New Pipeline' button

- Ask Anne about bioimage check for how good programs are
