Mike's TODO list

- New, 6-15-06. - add the pipeline to the figure for each application (like we did for Figure 1a).

- Combine Five Biotechniques figures into three by combining Figures 3-5 all together - maybe rotate the lungs in figure 3 90 degrees to give you enough room to put the pipeline at the left. Here is the legend for the new mega-figure:
Figure 3: Identification and measurement of GFP-labeled tumors in mouse lungs, the wound healing assay, and Drosophila tissue topology.  (A) The pipeline of modules used for the analysis shown in B-D. (B) Original image. (C) Image with tumors outlined by CellProfiler. (D) Tumors in a set of 20 images were counted by CellProfiler and by two researchers. The manual tumor count for each image (vertical axis) is plotted versus the CellProfiler count (horizontal axis), revealing strong concordance (R2 value is shown). (E) The pipeline of modules used for the analysis shown in F-G. (F) At timepoint zero, the wound visible in the original image (top) is large and the cells present at the edges of the image cover a small percentage of the area of the image, as quantified by CellProfiler (bottom). (G) After 24 hours, the wound has recovered due to cells migrating from the edges (top) and now is much smaller in measured size (bottom). (H) The pipeline of modules used for the analysis shown in I-J. (I) Original image of Drosophila epithelial cells growing in a sheet. Box indicates the region shown enlarged below. (J) Image showing cells identified and color-coded by CellProfiler based on how many neighbors they have.

- Check that all the pipelines posted on the web are up to date with the code that is on the web (UROPs can do?) - I was worried about Neighbors, but I guess we haven't posted a new version of code so maybe it is not a problem. In the meantime, the UROPs could test all pipe's with the current code and update things so they are ready for the next release?
--------------
- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES

- Tell people at lab meeting about our storage closet downstairs. I think most people don't know.

- As we discovered, Plate fix in the Crop module works to force the coordinates to be used each time freshly (when doing rectangle, coordinates). Can you describe in the help why/how this works? I guess in my case none of the rows/columns were 50% empty, so the real purpose of Plate fix was thwarted, while the cute side benefit of repeating use of the coordinates was used?
