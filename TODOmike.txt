Mike's TODO list

****** Anne 1/7 - MANUSCRIPT FIGURES ******

Still need the percent difference for cell counts (FIg 2A) between CP and Manual and between Manual 1 and Manual 2 (i think we had a bunch of emails going back and forth about this).

Please upload the website, it has changed.

Figure 5:  Anne 1-26-06: Process 2nd BioImage CNT image set, from Arne.
[PROBABLY DONE, WAIT FOR ANNE TO ANALYZE AND SEE IF WE REALLY NEED ANYTHING MORE ON THIS].

Figure 2D (G2/M separation)
- For part 2 we hope we Will use jason's suggested mutant and see if we can see an increase in metaphase nuclei. {UPDATE: We have already done a full phenotypic analysis of jason's image set - In Han is setting up CV to access this data and then we can go into the database and look for high p-H3 staining + small nuclei + eccentric nuclei and look for hits and then check the original images to see if they look metaphase arrested.}
[PICK SOMETHING FROM THE NIRHT_4N_nucsize hit list that looks like it has a lot of metaphase nuclei. TEMP COPY of these images are on CP_G5 so you can choose a nice one. We might need to use shape (eccentricity) too - not just nuc size and 4N content. We wrote out two options for displaying - not sure which will be nicer.] [[UPDATE 1-26-06: I think now you have that spot number we found when looking with Ray and that is the image you want to use for this, right?]]

Figure 2I (kiger hits quantified)
- We need to figure out if it will be feasible to find neat Kiger examples. We can use images from our kc genome-wide screen (or her original images).
[[[RAY IS SORT OF WORKING ON THIS, SO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE COMES UP WITH]]]

Anne 1-27-06: Switch the positions and rename figure 4B and C (be careful because 4B has so many little elements that are not grouped at the moment. Then, draw lines from the proper row of the new 4B (red heatmap) to the proper panel of the new 4C (charts). E.g. panel 1 is cell count so a line should go from line 1 of the heatmap to this chart.  See the supplemental table 4 to figure out which panel is which row of the figure. Hopefully it will be pretty easy to match up.

Post all the example images and pipelines at cellprofiler.org

****** END OF MANUSCRIPT PROJECTS ******

When the manuscript is submitted, *please* move *everything* you've ever processed on the G5's and your PC to its own, dated experiment folder on sabatini3_ata, within a Figure folder if appropriate.

Prepare stuff to send to Sheldon for OME - test which substructures are needed for running CP 'headless'. Add this info to the programming notes, too (list of substructures needed by modules: X,y,z)

FIGURE OUT WHY NUMBERS ARE WEIRD FOR PHOSPHO HISTONE 3 DATA IN DATABASE - e.g. why isn't pH3 staining within the nucleus???

Note: sample 48 = String, sample 340 = CyclinA

Anne 1/17: I think you mentioned wanting to make MergeBatchOutput a data tool rather than a module so that we fix the time elapsed problems that were preventing exporting. Also, MergeBatchOutput produces an output file that has lost its real pipeline - the pipeline is just the MergeBatchOutput module. It should take the Pipeline and settings from the Batch_data.mat (first image set's output file).

Anne 12/23: I noticed something peculiar in the movie I am analyzing - several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance. Can you check whether this is true for other images, and if it's a bug? [Anne asked Ola 1/9/06]

Anne 1/5: Playing with Jason's human images: the data is already processed through CellProfiler, but we have to fix a few images... some of the puro
+ (which is supposed to kill uninfected cells) identified
hundreds of nuclei instead of zero (bad thresholding).  We need to go
back in and fix this at some point.  I think the spots where it
happened are obvious: they have a very low threshold.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES
