% Help for the Correct Illumination Subtract Each Min module: 
% Category: Pre-processing
% 
% This module corrects for uneven illumination of each image, based on
% information contained only within that image.  It is preferable to
% use a correct illumination module that corrects for illumination
% based on all images acquired at the same time.
%
% How it works:
% First, the minimum pixel value is determined within each "block" of
% the image.  The block dimensions are entered by the user, and should
% be large enough that every block is likely to contain some
% "background" pixels, where no cells are located.  Theoretically, the
% intensity values of these background pixels should always be the
% same number.  With uneven illumination, the background pixels will
% vary across the image, and this yields a function that presumably
% affects the intensity of the "real" pixels, those that comprise
% cells. Therefore, once the minimums are determined across the image,
% the minimums are smoothed out. This produces an image that
% represents the variation in illumination across the field of view.
% This image is then subtracted from the original image to produce the
% corrected image.  Note: This is the same strategy as Correct Illum
% Divide Each Min, but the background is subtracted out of the image
% instead of divided.
% 
% This module does not rescale or otherwise adjust the resulting
% image, so that intensity measurements will be accurate, assuming
% that all images should have the same background levels (at spots
% where no cells are located).
% 
% This module is based on the Matlab demo "Correction of non-uniform
% illumination" in the Image Processing Toolbox demos "Enhancement"
% category.
% MATLAB6p5/toolbox/images/imdemos/examples/enhance/ipss003.html
%
% SAVING IMAGES: The illumination corrected images produced by this
% module can be easily saved using the Save Images module, using the
% name you assign. If you want to save other intermediate images,
% alter the code for this module to save those images to the handles
% structure (see the SaveImages module help) and then use the Save
% Images module.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HELP:
% The first unbroken block of lines will be extracted as help by
% CellProfiler's 'Help for this analysis module' button as well as
% Matlab's built in 'help' and 'doc' functions at the command line. It
% will also be used to automatically generate a manual page for the
% module. An example image demonstrating the function of the module
% can also be saved in tif format, using the same name as the
% algorithm (minus Alg), and it will automatically be included in the
% manual page as well.  Follow the convention of purpose of the
% module, description of the variables and acceptable range for each,
% how it works (technical description), info on which images can be 
% saved, and See also CAPITALLETTEROTHERALGORITHMS. The license/author
% information should be separated from the help lines with a blank
% line so that it does not show up in the help displays.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW:
% The 'drawnow' function allows figure windows to be updated and
% buttons to be pushed (like the pause, cancel, help, and view
% buttons).  The 'drawnow' function is sprinkled throughout the code
% so there are plenty of breaks where the figure windows/buttons can
% be interacted with.  This does theoretically slow the computation
% somewhat, so it might be reasonable to remove most of these lines
% when running jobs on a cluster where speed is important.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% VARIABLE BOXES AND TEXT: 
% The '%textVAR' lines contain the text which is displayed in the GUI
% next to each variable box. The '%defaultVAR' lines contain the
% default values which are displayed in the variable boxes when the
% user loads the algorithm. The line of code after the textVAR and
% defaultVAR extracts the value that the user has entered from the
% handles structure and saves it as a variable in the workspace of
% this algorithm with a descriptive name. The syntax is important for
% the %textVAR and %defaultVAR lines: be sure there is a space before
% and after the equals sign and also that the capitalization is as
% shown.  Don't allow the text to wrap around to another line; the
% second line will not be displayed.  If you need more space to
% describe a variable, you can refer the user to the help file, or you
% can put text in the %textVAR line above or below the one of
% interest, and do not include a %defaultVAR line so that the variable
% edit box for that variable will not be displayed; the text will
% still be displayed. CellProfiler is currently being restructured to
% handle more than 11 variable boxes. Keep in mind that you can have
% several inputs into the same box: for example, a box could be
% designed to receive two numbers separated by a comma, as long as you
% write a little extraction algorithm that separates the input into
% two distinct variables.  Any extraction algorithms like this should
% be within the VARIABLES section of the code, at the end.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DISPLAYING RESULTS:
% Each module checks whether its figure is open before calculating
% images that are for display only. This is done by examining all the
% figure handles for one whose handle is equal to the assigned figure
% number for this algorithm. If the figure is not open, everything
% between the "if" and "end" is ignored (to speed execution), so do
% not do any important calculations here. Otherwise an error message
% will be produced if the user has closed the window but you have
% attempted to access data that was supposed to be produced by this
% part of the code. If you plan to save images which are normally
% produced for display only, the corresponding lines should be moved
% outside this if statement.

fieldname = ['figurealgorithm',CurrentAlgorithm];
ThisAlgFigureNumber = handles.(fieldname);
if any(findobj == ThisAlgFigureNumber) == 1;
% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW BEFORE FIGURE COMMAND:
% The "drawnow" function executes any pending figure window-related
% commands.  In general, Matlab does not update figure windows until
% breaks between image analysis modules, or when a few select commands
% are used. "figure" and "drawnow" are two of the commands that allow
% Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window- related
% commands (like zooming, or pressing timer pause or cancel buttons or
% pressing a help button.)  If the drawnow command is not used
% immediately prior to the figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber) line, then
% immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands that
% have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then, when
% Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line, the
% figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one. This
% results in strange things like the subplots appearing in the timer
% window or in the wrong figure window, or in help dialog boxes.
drawnow
    %%% Activates the appropriate figure window.
    figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber);
    %%% A subplot of the figure window is set to display the original image.

%%% SAVE DATA TO HANDLES STRUCTURE %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
% In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent function
% (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see' variables
% produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared from one
% module to the next, they must be saved to what is called the
% 'handles structure'. This is a variable of class structure which is
% called handles. Data which should be saved to the handles structure
% within each module includes: any images, data or measurements which
% are to be eventually saved to the hard drive (either in an output
% file, or using the SaveImages module) or which must be used by a
% later module in the analysis pipeline. It is important to think
% about which of these data should be deleted at the end of an
% analysis run because of the way Matlab saves variables: For example,
% a user might process 12 image sets of nuclei which results in a set
% of 12 measurements ("TotalNucArea") stored in the handles structure.
% In addition, a processed image of nuclei from the last image set is
% left in the handles structure ("SegmNucImg").  Now, if the user uses
% a different algorithm which happens to have the same measurement
% output name "TotalNucArea" to analyze 4 image sets, the 4
% measurements will overwrite the first 4 measurements of the previous
% analysis, but the remaining 8 measurements will still be present.
% So, the user will end up with 12 measurements from the 4 sets.
% Another potential problem is that if, in the second analysis run,
% the user runs only an algorithm which depends on the output
% "SegmNucImg" but does not run an algorithm that produces an image by
% that name, the algorithm will run just fine: it will just repeatedly
% use the processed image of nuclei leftover from the last image set,
% which was left in the handles structure ("SegmNucImg").
%
% INCLUDE FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF MEASUREMENTS PER CELL AND PER IMAGE
% HERE>>>
%
% The data extraction functions of CellProfiler are designed to deal
% with only one "column" of data per named measurement field. So, for
% example, instead of creating a field of XY locations stored in
% pairs, it is better to store a field of X locations and a field of Y
% locations.

%%% Saves the corrected image to the handles structure so it can be used by
%%% subsequent algorithms.
fieldname = ['dOT', CorrectedImageName];
handles.(fieldname) = CorrectedImage;

%%% Determines the filename of the image to be analyzed.
fieldname = ['dOTFilename', ImageName];
FileName = handles.(fieldname)(handles.setbeinganalyzed);
%%% Saves the original file name ito the handles structure in a
%%% field named after the corrected image name.
fieldname = ['dOTFilename', CorrectedImageName];
handles.(fieldname)(handles.setbeinganalyzed) = FileName;
