CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 

- FAIRLY URGENT Anne 7-7-06: It would be great if CellProfiler could read ZVI format images. Someone has already written an open-source java-based ZVI reader:
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/zvi-reader.html so hopefully that program would help figure out the format so we can alter CPimread to handle this image type. Notice how we handle DIB format images in CPimread for an example. I put example ZVI images in the DeveloperDropBox (two files named SNAP...)

- Ray 7-6-06: We should perhaps write a module that can do tracking, perhaps something as simple as "assign nuclei in image B the same label as the closest nucleus in image A," with some magic for splitting/merging when necessary.

- Anne 7-11-06: The Crop module, when in rectangle mode, gives an error if you click outside the image (in mouse mode) or enter a pixel value outside the range of the image (in coordinates mode). Instead, as we have already adjusted in the ellipse option, it should do something like this (and inform the user that this is what has been done): CPmsgbox('You have chosen points outside of the range of the image. These points have been rounded to the closest compatible number.');

- Anne 7-11-06: The Crop module, in mouse/ellipse mode, does not visibly mark the points that you have clicked. It's kind of strange because I think at one point it did this successfully, and the mouse/rectangle mode works just fine, creating little star marks wherever you have clicked.

- Anne 6-30-06: Find Edges, MaskImage, CalculateMath, Combine module need documentation and help. Check all the data tools, image tools, and modules to see that there is at least some documentation - sometimes we copy a new module from an old one, so there might be help there, BUT it's from the OLD MODULE! In these cases, we should delete the help and say "Sorry, this module is undocumented."

- Anne 6-21-06: try using MATLAB's function memmapfile to use memory mapping when loading really large images to see if it helps relieve 'out of memory' issues. We have super-large 5x scans of entire slides to use in this testing. If this works well, we should have "run in memory mapping mode for large images?" as a preference in Set Preferences, and then we would adjust the CPretrieveimage subfunction (or whatever it's called) to check whether we are in memory mapping mode or not in order to decide how to retrieve images. It's unclear to me whether this would involve a ridiculous amount of change - for example, would we have to change every module that stores an image in the handles to store it in a particular special way?

- (Anne 6/12/06) - It appears that pixel size is not loaded when you load old pipelines from output files. See the developer's note for info about pixel size; it's supposed to be in handles.Settings. We should probably check all instances where pixel size is used/stored and make absolutely sure it makes sense.

- (Anne 6/12/06) - Do we have developer's instructions somewhere that warn about code changes that will also require changes in your compiling process? It would be good if Anne and the summer students are more aware of them so things don't crash and burn!

- (Anne 5/26/06) - Make "subobject" data exportable - I am pretty sure right now we cannot get individual speckle data out, for example? Also, exporting the identity of neighbors I think is not currently possible.

- (Anne 5/25/06) - What are our latest stats for # downloads, interesting institutions/companies, mac vs pc, etc.

- (Anne 5/22/06) - When we run large image sets, we usually run an illumination correction pipeline. It would be nice if this pipeline would calculate a suggested 'minimum allowable threshold', to be used in the IdentifyPrim and IdentifySec modules. Right now, we choose it empirically.

- (Anne 5/12/06) - Add more shape measures to MeasureObjectAreaShape. The Image processing handbook has some described starting on page 513 and the Shape analysis and classification book has some starting on page 422. See also articles that Anne has: {Rodenacker, 2003 A feature set for cytometry on digitized microscopic images}{Boland, 2001 #A neural network classifier capable of recognizing the patterns of all major subcellular structures in fluorescence microscope images of HeLa cells}  Another useful feature: # of invaginations of the perimeter.  Also investigate Tchebyshev orthogonal moments, which are supposedly described in an article currently in press at Pattern Recognition, by Bartek (short for a longer name) Rajwa in Robinson's lab at Purdue. I requested the article from him May 22. How about Fourier measures of shape? Is that a good idea?
See also comments from Ray:
Hi Ray,
I just heard a talk about measuring shape in images, and the speaker
compared three inputs: the binary object, a polygon (explicit curve)
and an implicit curve (something about modeling it as a 3D curve that
crosses a plane at a certain level). THey found that the binary, due to
quantization, was particularly bad at capturing shape properties. - this
may be what jeff price was talking about when he thought that we might
be seeing a correlation of some zernikes with size. Is this an area we
ought to improve?
-a
Actually, I doubt Matlab does much more than the usual quantization
approach, but we can check.  It's probably slower to do anything with
curves or implicit curves, which would probably need to loop over
objects.  The binary masks can use the faster matrix/vector
operations. What might make sense for the Zernike and other shape measures is to
do some experiments with large shapes and progressively smaller
versions created by downsampling.  Then we can get an idea how much
those shapes vary as the resolution drops, and we might be able to
estimate ranges for those measurements, rather than just a single
estimate with no indication of its accuracy. - Ray

- (Anne 5/20/06) - Is it possible to have our shape/texture measures match up with those used my Robert Murphy's lab at Carnegie Mellon? I think already our Haralick texture features are nicely categorized using his nomenclature but it's worth checking our other measures to be sure that they are proper categories with the proper SLF numbers.

- (Anne 5/10/06) - When analyzing images in CellProfiler, after every cycle should we check to see what images are used downstream (checking all the imagegroup members) and strip the rest out?

- (Anne 5/10/06) - IMPORTANT The propagate algorithm works very nicely in our IdSec module. We should add this as an option for the IdPrimAutomatic module (It would be a new method for finding the dividing lines between clumped objects, along with Intensity and Distance.)

- (Anne 5/10/06) - IMPORTANT Improve automatic thresholding, i.e. background/cell edge finding - threshold vs. adaptive threshold vs. watershed. Implement Ray's belief propagation idea?  Implement Jeff Price's FIR filter idea? (Price, Hunter, Gough Cytometry 1996), although we need to mark with a disclaimer that it's for academic purposes only because for commercial use, it's patented, and also Jeff says it does not deal with clumpy objects, so I guess it's for thresholding only, it is not a complete segmentation solution. See this article (anne has a copy): {Sezgin, 2004 #Survey over image thresholding techniques and quantitative performance evaluation, Journal of Electronic Imaging} See also Ridler-Calvard thresholding: I heard about it at a meeting in relation to Otsu's method and it's unclear whether it has any advantages.

- (Anne 4/25/06) - Rename MergeOutputFiles and ConvertBatchFiles to be consistent with each other (maybe both should be BatchOutputFiles?)

- (Anne 4/25/06) - The inability to nicely scroll the help windows is pretty annoying on the mac platform. Why can't we resize the window? Maybe there is a good reason.

- (Anne 4-21-06) Get the code from Shen, Nelson, Kennedy et al: Automatic tracking of biological cells and compartments using particle filters and active contours, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, in press. At least try implementing the object-identification algorithm into IdentifyPrimAutomatic, but perhaps do the kinetic (time-lapse) part too.

- (Anne 4-19-06) - I fixed a bug in SaveImages module so that a proper error message appears if you specify an image file name for the base name that is not in the handles structure already. But we should doublecheck that SaveImages still works for the cases when the base name is (1) N for sequential numbers (2) type in one file name for all the images (=DesiredFilename), then appending sequential numbers using the following variable set to N, and (3) type in one file name for all the images (=DesiredFilename) for the case where you want to save an avi movie.

- (Anne 3-21-06) - In the installation instructions, one of the first things you are supposed to do is Set Preferences -> Modules. I just wanted to doublecheck that this step has to be done - there is no way we can at least attempt to figure it out?

- (Requested by Colin 3/20) - I think if you change a indep infotype and then click on another module before clicking anywhere else, it doesn't actually add the new infotype.

- (Requested by Anne 2-24-06) - I just fixed a bug in LoadImages where if the user typed in 'automatic' in lower case for the two variables (blur and neighborhood suppression) it failed and gave an inexplicable error message. All I had to do was change the strcmp to strcmpi to make it case-insensitive. I think that this is probably a common thing we overlooked. We should go through the code and look for all strcmp and strncmp and replace with the case-insensitive versions strcmpi and strncmpi where appropriate. We don't want to just find and replace all of them because occasionally it might be necessary to be case sensitive! The tool in Matlab Edit > Find Files should be helpful to find all the instances of strcmp in the m files.

- (Requested by Anne 2-12-06) -In the DevDropBox, there is a ProblemOtsuPIPE  plus two images (IIllumImageRescaled.mat and whitelight_DSC00001.JPG) that yields an error in MeasureAreaImageOccupied, but only when i choose Otsu Adaptive - Otsu global seems fine.

(Anne 2-9-06) Usually I name (in an IdentifyPrimAutomatic module) the outlines so they can later be overlaid on an image. When I type in the name in IdentifyPrimAutomatic and then go to the OverlayOutlines module, the new outlines name is not selectable. If I go back and click on the outlines name again and press enter and then go back to OverlayOutlines, it finally shows up. So it seems like some sort of little bug.

- (Requested by Anne 1-17-06) - Histogram data tool requests:
* When the Histogram function fails in CPhistbins (e.g. if you enter a min greater than your max), it yields errors at the command line - they are not caught properly.
* I put in an error catch for the case where you have a negative number for the min histogram bin value, but try to plot in log scale, because it fails. Can we make this work?
* Overall, the compressed heat maps section seems poorly designed - we kind of threw it together. (esp swapping the axes, 'image' vs 'bin' - the X and Y axis labels are swapped for one of the modes.) Need to go through and make it more logical, perhaps by adding subfunctions to consolidate the code.
* When making compressed heat maps, it does not seem to round off the tick labels - there are tons of decimal places. Can we fix? It seems like the compressed heat maps should have the same options as the other types of histograms: fewer tick labels, change number of decimals (wait, maybe that's from the ShowDataOnImage tool), etc.

- (Requested by Anne 1-17-06) - POTENTIAL REAL PROJECT - This paper has many thresholding functions implemented. We could add many of them to CP, or at least the best one: Rajagopalan, Lu, Yaszemski, Robb, J Biomed Mater Res 2005. When finished, we should compare to current results and see if it improves things. Right now, thresholding is a real problem for us.

- (Requested by Anne 1-17-06) - POTENTIAL REAL PROJECT - We should make a new module to calculate the KS statistic for every image set. It would require notifying the software which images are controls, because this statistic compares the distribution of individual cell measures from each image to the distribution of individual cell measures from the control image(s). Once finished, we should see whether the calculated KS statistic produces a better Z' score than the 'percent above threshold' method for the BioImage cyto-nuc translocation assay.

See also Wilson, Si, Thompson, Smellie, Ashwell et al, J Biomol Screen 2005 or 2006 "Identification of a small molecule that induces mitotic arrest using s simplified high-content screening assay and data analysis method." because this has an example where KS statistics are calculated between several control images and this value is subtracted from the KS values for each image.

- (Requested by Anne 12-16-05)- Design an informational brochure

- (Requested by Anne 12-15-05)- Should we somehow refresh memory after every cycle of CP? It gets slower and slower with each cycle which can be fixed by using Restart module, so something must be up with the memory handling. See matlab's pack function, perhaps.

---------------------------------------------------

THINGS TO DO WHEN NEW VERSIONS OF MATLAB COME OUT:

- update the image file formats that are readable in LoadImages modules and saveable in SaveImages module and SaveImageAs Image tool. 

- update the colormaps available.

- For many functions we have made our own CP versions - check the new matlab code to see if they've changed anything that would warrant us re-creating the CP subfunctions to use the new code.

---------------------------------------------------

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Make some subfunctions for redundant code in AddData, ClearData.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Make a data tool for normalization - see the help in Data Layout for starters.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Make preferences work a bit better when having more than one copy of CP on a computer. E.g. if I start CP in my own copy of trunk/CellProfiler, it reads that previously I set the modules folder to someone else's trunk/CellProfiler, so it adds *their* Modules folder to the top of my path. In fact, perhaps we should not have the Modules folder be stored in the pref's anyway - it should just always be the Modules folder within the currently running CellProfiler!!

- (Requested by Anne 12-01-05) - Make compiled CellProfiler work on cluster

- (Requested by Anne 12-01-05) - Tile used to allow us to show text information loaded using LoadText. DisplayGridInfo does something similar, but would it be very hard to add this back to the Tile module? It's nice to have it in the same window because you can show/hide that text info in addition to show/hide the file names, etc.

- (Requested by Anne 11-21-05) - Calculations shouldnt be made if they don't need to be (outlines, colored label matrix for display)

- (Requested by Anne 10-25-05) - ProcessOutlines (in DeveloperScripts) needs to be updated:  We need to rename this module IdentifyPrimBasedOnOutlines. State in the help whether the incoming image should be black background with white outlines or vice versa. We need to make this like the other Primary modules, which I think means we need to add fields like 'Edited' in the handles.Pipeline. I think we also need to produce fields in the handles.Measurements structure indicating Object count and maybe location too. See IdentifyPrimAutomatic to make this one consistent.  Doublecheck the IdentifyPrimManual to be sure it's consistent while we are at it.

- Improve speed of ordfilt2 used by CPsmooth (takes forever). Look into getting new code at mathworks website or anywhere else. Something that does the same thing.

- Combine code for Histograms (ISN'T This done already?)

- (Requested by Anne 11-28-05) - Make the expand or shrink module work well with shrinking secondary objects.

- (Requested by Anne 11-08-05) - Can we make PlotMeasurements as cool as Histograms? e.g. selecting subsets of images, 'gating' by plotting only cells above a threshold in a particular measurement.

-(Mike 11/14 I think this can be done with invisible plot but i couldnt get it to work) (Requested by Anne) - Define grid: the row labels should be on the right (not left) and the column labels on the top (not bottom) so that the pixel locations are still visible on the left and bottom.

-(Mike 11/14 This idea was shot down a long time ago because of all the issues with popup menus, maybe in the future, but definitely not before release) (Requested by Color 11-08-5) - It would be nice to be able to some variables in multiple groups for menus.  For instance, we could put images from load modules in both imagegroup and a new origimagegroup.  That way for the modules that require and original image (such as for the filenames in SaveImages) would only have the original images from load modules instead of everything.

- (Requested by Anne 11-01-05) - There are many ways to measure the best focus of an image. Right now our MeasureSaturationBlur module has only one of these methods. Implement many of the focus methods in this paper, and have the 'best'/fastest one be the default: Sun, Duthaler, Nelson, Microscopy Research & Technique 2004 (Anne has the pdf of this).



- (Requested by Anne) - right now we choose between intensity and shape (or distance) at two places in IdentifyPrimAutomatic. It might be cool to develop a more sophisticated method that allows you to balance the input of these two sources of information.



- (Requested by Anne 9-28-05) - Build some kind of module that allows interfacing with ImageJ so that routines built for ImageJ can be run in CellProfiler??  No idea how complicated this would be.

>>> See practice ImageJ integration ideas below (two of them). Build a wrapping function that is a CP module which allows using ImageJ as a back end.



- (Requested by Anne 11-02-05) - The paper Ortiz de Solorzano, Malladi, Lockett, J Microscopy 2001 has what looks like a really nice segmentation method. I think that the only problem is that it is slow, which they were planning to address in future work. It would be nice to contact the authors to see if they have any new algorithms and implement them into CP.



- (Requested by Anne 11-02-05) - The paper Malladi & Sethian PNAS 1995 has what looks like a really nice filter that makes objects more obvious in images with lots of noise.   It would be nice to contact the authors to see if they have any new algorithms and implement them into CP.



- (Requested by Anne 9-19-05) - For cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation, implement Ilya Ravkin's technique where instead of having a binary mask that denotes nucleus vs cytoplasm, there is a weighted function that is based on the nuclear stain. The Univ. Delft people have done similar work in this area.



- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - http://wiki.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/Main_Page has open source algorithms we could implement.



- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - Add a nice alignment (image registration) algorithm for ImageJ that can be found at: http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms.html
Which is referenced in Sage IEEE 2005 as one of the best. Make sure it isn't the same as the algorithm we already have in Align.m!

  - Write algorithms to compare hand-traced results to CellProfiler

       results quantitatively, then apply them to our hand-traced data

       sets. [2 parts: 1) segment manual images.  2) match object to object, 

	 3) signed distance transfer]



     - Allow batches of different settings to be run and their results

       compared 



     - Allow automatic selection of settings based on hand-traced images



     - Get someone to Hand-outline a second set of images to compare

       to Chris' set. 



     - Make separate Identify Secondary modules: one for bright lines

       and one for dark lines between objects.  Also try watershedding

       the gradient image rather than the original. 





- (Requested by Anne 10-13-05) - There is a fairly simple routine in Janssens, et al., Dev Genes Evol 2005 (215:374-381) for drosophila cells in embryos. It might be fun to implement this routine into a CP pipeline.


- (Requested by Anne 11-03-05) - There is a paper: Kam, Bioimaging 1998 on line integration and deconvolution of DIC images which would be a cool filter to implement that might allow people to analyze DIC images.


-(Requested by Anne 8-23-05) - Try to get yeast identification working for phase contrast images - we set up something for SErge Pelet, but haven't really gone at this application in a systematic way - a lot of people want this and I think it's doable but we just haven't put in the effort. IdentifyPrimYeastPhase was one attempt, but it's very empirical and not very adjustable for other images. In fact, it doesn't even work well at the moment for the original images, from Ben 03_25_2005.  Check into the literature for better methods or try to get that method working. Not sure if these references are for fluorescence or phase images:

       SCMD: Saccharomyces cerevisiae Morphological Database. Nucleic Acids Res.

             2004 Jan 1;32 Database issue:D319-22. PMID: 14681423

Perhaps more promising is the paper Coelho, M, Ferreira et al, Applied Microbial and Cell Physiol, 2004, where they mention having Matlab code to accomplish yeast cell segmentation (Anne has this paper).



- (Requested by Colin) - The measure modules create an error when a label matrix with an object completely missing is given to it.  We took care of this by making Identify modules create a single pixel if an object is missing.  It would be nice to allow objects to be missing in measurement modules.  Also, once the measurement modules are working, make sure it is possible to export the data to excel.



VISION 2 +++  (Requested by Anne) -Improve foreground/background determination for the IdentifySecPropagate module.  Ask Ray for advice. Here is one idea:

Make the background correction based on Each image (rather than All images) a little more sophisticated as follows: Cell segmentation and llumination correction can be made simultaneously for best result.

The usual procedure is as follows (the technique is called Expectation Maximization segmentation):

Segment cells

Estimate illumination variation from the background and correct the original image

Re-segment cells

Re-estimate illumination variation from the background and correct the original image

Re-segment cells

Repeat until convergence.

The iterations can be performed on a low-resolution version of the original image, e.g. 200x200 pixels, so I don't think it's time-consuming.  This will involve figuring out how to call a downstream Identify module to use the settings and code from the downstream module (otherwise we'd have to build background subtraction into every identify module).

Debeir,  Decaestacker IEEE TRans. Medical Imaging vol 24 no 6 June 2005. I don't really understand the algorithm in this one.

Miura Adv Biochem Engin/Biotech 2005 95:267-295 is a nice overview.

See also Niven, Fuks, J MIcrobiol Methods 2005 where they feed XY locations into a program they wrote called ObjectTracker, which might be helpful.



- (Requested by Anne) - If we want to extend CP to analyze 3D images, there is a good example available here: Gue, Messaoudi, Sun, Boudier Cytometry 2005 on Smart 3D-FISH. It's available as an imageJ plug in so it might be good as a practice to integrate ImageJ and CP.



- (Requested by Anne) - New algorithm to calculate colocalization. Ask Ray if it seems like a good idea. One part of the paper is simply describing the concept of masking the image for the region of interest (ROI) prior to calculating the correlation coefficient, which we already do. But the second part is a different calculation which may be superior to the one we use, but not sure: Jaskolski, Mulle, Manzoni J Neurosci Methods 146(2005) 42-49. The matlab code is apparently available from the authors.

[ASK RAY IF THIS IS WORTH IT (HE SAYS PROBABLY NOT)]>

+++ Restructure CellProfiler.m so that the GUI creates a configuration file which is then sent to a simple pipeline program. That would make farming out jobs to multiple machines easier, running a job that broke somewhere, and it would make it easier to create new GUIs aimed at different tasks, if people wanted to. The current GUI wouldn't actually need to change, it could still call the pipeline-running-function and parse errors from it (which is a definite good thing to keep around).   It would be entirely under the hood.
