- Anne 7-7-06: the histogram flipping looks great and hopefully will make the reviewers of our paper happy! I only noticed one small problem, when you plot something with the axes flipped and then add a control histogram, the control histogram is not flipped but is in the normal orientation instead. It would be a reasonable solution to just disable/remove the button when in flipped mode, because I don't think people will use that combination very often. But if it's easy to fix, go ahead. Also, the button Export Data To MATLAB should be non visible when running the compiled version. I don't know how we normally disable functions in the compiled version, but Mike can tell you.

- Anne 6-21-06: We would like to run some tests to try to improve CellProfiler's speed: 
* Change CPimread to put the images in single format rather than double. We hypothesize that subsequent processing in single format will be faster. We are pretty certain that we won't lose any precision, because we are using 12-bit and occasionally 16-bit images, whereas single precision already has more than 20-bit data storage capability; therefore we think double precision is overkill. However, we don't know whether all of the matlab functions will work on single format numbers, so we should run a long test pipeline to see if any errors result. It's also possible that many MATLAB functions may process single precision numbers by converting to double and back again, which would make single precision numbers be slower! Run comparisons of how long processing takes in double and in single format to help us decide whether it's worth it to switch to single.
* What are the most time-consuming steps of IdentifyPrimAutomatic? Use the "Profiler" tool within MATLAB to determine this.
=>Jun: Testing done 7/3/06-7/10/06, documented in word file. It seems that it's not worth it to switch to single format. In some cases, double is faster and in other cases single is faster, but the difference is usually only 10% or less. There are also a few errors associated with switching to single.

- (Anne 6/12/06) - After you save preferences, it tells you that they are saved in the matlab root directory, which is not true for the non-developer's version of CellProfiler (see the Set Preferences window for a description of what really happens; i think it is up to date).
=>Jun: Changes made 6/30/06. CellProfiler.m committed on 6/30/06.

(Anne 6/27/06): Need to add option to Histogram menu to flip x and y axes when plotting graphs.
=>Jun: Changes made 6/27/06-6/30/06. Histogram.m in DataTools committed on 6/30/06.

- Anne 6-20-06: Let's make a more informative error window that tells the user possible reasons why the image might not be found:
Question:"I have been trying to persuade CellProfiler to save images generated by tiled, but every time SaveImages complains about not being able to find the input image. I set this to be the output image of Tiled. I am running cellprofiler on MacOS 10.4.6. Am I missing something or is this a known bug ... "
Answer: "The full tiled image is only made on the final cycle, so you must set the SaveImages module to save on "Last Cycle" instead of All. That should take care of your problem!"
=> Jun: Changes made 6/23/06-6/27/06. Processing will continue when user saves tiled image(s) on cycles other than the last. Instead of an error, user gets warning. Error still occurs for images not existent in pipeline. SaveImages.m and Tile.m in Modules committed on 6/30/06.

- (Anne 6/12/06) - LoadSingleImage seems to spit its text display into other windows, depending on what you have open and are looking at. Maybe this a fluke, transient thing but perhaps we can make it put its text in the proper window more consistently? If we fix it for this module, make sure LoadImages is also working similarly.
=> Jun: Changes made 6/22/06. LoadImages.m and LoadSingleImage.m in Modules committed on 6/30/06.
