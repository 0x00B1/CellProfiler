function handles = MeasureAreaOccupied(handles)

% Help for the Measure Area Occupied module: 
% Category: Measurement
% 
% This module simply measures the total area covered by stain in an
% image. 
%
% Settings:
%
% Threshold: The threshold affects the stringency of the lines between
% the objects and the background. You may enter an absolute number
% between 0 and 1 for the threshold (use 'Show pixel data' to see the
% pixel intensities for your images in the appropriate range of 0 to
% 1), or you may have it calculated for each image individually by
% typing 0.  There are advantages either way.  An absolute number
% treats every image identically, but an automatically calculated
% threshold is more realistic/accurate, though occasionally subject to
% artifacts.  The threshold which is used for each image is recorded
% as a measurement in the output file, so if you find unusual
% measurements from one of your images, you might check whether the
% automatically calculated threshold was unusually high or low
% compared to the remaining images.  When an automatic threshold is
% selected, it may consistently be too stringent or too lenient, so an
% adjustment factor can be entered as well. The number 1 means no
% adjustment, 0 to 1 makes the threshold more lenient and greater than
% 1 (e.g. 1.3) makes the threshold more stringent.
%
% How it works:
% This module applies a threshold to the incoming image so that any
% pixels brighter than the specified value are assigned the value 1
% (white) and the remaining pixels are assigned the value zero
% (black), producing a binary image.  The number of white pixels are
% then counted.  This provides a measurement of the area occupied by
% fluorescence.  The threshold is calculated automatically and then
% adjusted by a user-specified factor. It might be desirable to write
% a new module where the threshold can be set to a constant value.
%
% SAVING IMAGES: If you want to save images produced by this module,
% alter the code for this module to save those images to the handles
% structure (see the SaveImages module help) and then use the Save
% Images module.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HELP:
% The first unbroken block of lines will be extracted as help by
% CellProfiler's 'Help for this analysis module' button as well as Matlab's
% built in 'help' and 'doc' functions at the command line. It will also be
% used to automatically generate a manual page for the module. An example
% image demonstrating the function of the module can also be saved in tif
% format, using the same name as the module, and it will automatically be
% included in the manual page as well.  Follow the convention of: purpose
% of the module, description of the variables and acceptable range for
% each, how it works (technical description), info on which images can be 
% saved, and See also CAPITALLETTEROTHERMODULES. The license/author
% information should be separated from the help lines with a blank line so
% that it does not show up in the help displays.  Do not change the
% programming notes in any modules! These are standard across all modules
% for maintenance purposes, so anything module-specific should be kept
% separate.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW:
% The 'drawnow' function allows figure windows to be updated and
% buttons to be pushed (like the pause, cancel, help, and view
% buttons).  The 'drawnow' function is sprinkled throughout the code
% so there are plenty of breaks where the figure windows/buttons can
% be interacted with.  This does theoretically slow the computation
% somewhat, so it might be reasonable to remove most of these lines
% when running jobs on a cluster where speed is important.

%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% VARIABLE BOXES AND TEXT: 
% The '%textVAR' lines contain the variable descriptions which are
% displayed in the CellProfiler main window next to each variable box.
% This text will wrap appropriately so it can be as long as desired.
% The '%defaultVAR' lines contain the default values which are
% displayed in the variable boxes when the user loads the module.
% The line of code after the textVAR and defaultVAR extracts the value
% that the user has entered from the handles structure and saves it as
% a variable in the workspace of this module with a descriptive
% name. The syntax is important for the %textVAR and %defaultVAR
% lines: be sure there is a space before and after the equals sign and
% also that the capitalization is as shown. 
% CellProfiler uses VariableRevisionNumbers to help programmers notify
% users when something significant has changed about the variables.
% For example, if you have switched the position of two variables,
% loading a pipeline made with the old version of the module will not
% behave as expected when using the new version of the module, because
% the settings (variables) will be mixed up. The line should use this
% syntax, with a two digit number for the VariableRevisionNumber:
% '%%%VariableRevisionNumber = 01'  If the module does not have this
% line, the VariableRevisionNumber is assumed to be 00.  This number
% need only be incremented when a change made to the modules will affect
% a user's previously saved settings. There is a revision number at
% the end of the license info at the top of the m-file for revisions
% that do not affect the user's previously saved settings files.

%%% Reads the current module number, because this is needed to find 
%%% the variable values that the user entered.

% DRAWNOW BEFORE FIGURE COMMAND:
% The "drawnow" function executes any pending figure window-related
% commands.  In general, Matlab does not update figure windows until
% breaks between image analysis modules, or when a few select commands
% are used. "figure" and "drawnow" are two of the commands that allow
% Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window- related
% commands (like zooming, or pressing timer pause or cancel buttons or
% pressing a help button.)  If the drawnow command is not used
% immediately prior to the figure(ThisModuleFigureNumber) line, then
% immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands that
% have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then, when
% Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line, the
% figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one. This
% results in strange things like the subplots appearing in the timer
% window or in the wrong figure window, or in help dialog boxes.

%%% SAVE DATA TO HANDLES STRUCTURE %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
%       In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent
% function (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see'
% variables produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared
% from one module to the next, they must be saved to what is called
% the 'handles structure'. This is a variable, whose class is
% 'structure', and whose name is handles. The contents of the handles
% structure are printed out at the command line of Matlab using the
% Tech Diagnosis button. The only variables present in the main
% handles structure are handles to figures and gui elements.
% Everything else should be saved in one of the following
% substructures:
%
% handles.Settings:
%       Everything in handles.Settings is stored when the user uses
% the Save pipeline button, and these data are loaded into
% CellProfiler when the user uses the Load pipeline button. This
% substructure contains all necessary information to re-create a
% pipeline, including which modules were used (including variable
% revision numbers), their setting (variables), and the pixel size.
%   Fields currently in handles.Settings: PixelSize, ModuleNames,
% VariableValues, NumbersOfVariables, VariableRevisionNumbers.
%
% handles.Pipeline:
%       This substructure is deleted at the beginning of the
% analysis run (see 'Which substructures are deleted prior to an
% analysis run?' below). handles.Pipeline is for storing data which
% must be retrieved by other modules. This data can be overwritten as
% each image set is processed, or it can be generated once and then
% retrieved during every subsequent image set's processing, or it can
% be saved for each image set by saving it according to which image
% set is being analyzed, depending on how it will be used by other
% modules. Any module which produces or passes on an image needs to
% also pass along the original filename of the image, named after the
% new image name, so that if the SaveImages module attempts to save
% the resulting image, it can be named by appending text to the
% original file name.
%   Example fields in handles.Pipeline: FileListOrigBlue,
% PathnameOrigBlue, FilenameOrigBlue, OrigBlue (which contains the actual image).
%
% handles.Current:
%       This substructure contains information needed for the main
% CellProfiler window display and for the various modules to
% function. It does not contain any module-specific data (which is in
% handles.Pipeline).
%   Example fields in handles.Current: NumberOfModules,
% StartupDirectory, DefaultOutputDirectory, DefaultImageDirectory,
% FilenamesInImageDir, CellProfilerPathname, ImageToolHelp,
% DataToolHelp, FigureNumberForModule01, NumberOfImageSets,
% SetBeingAnalyzed, TimeStarted, CurrentModuleNumber.
%
% handles.Preferences: 
%       Everything in handles.Preferences is stored in the file
% CellProfilerPreferences.mat when the user uses the Set Preferences
% button. These preferences are loaded upon launching CellProfiler.
% The PixelSize, DefaultImageDirectory, and DefaultOutputDirectory
% fields can be changed for the current session by the user using edit
% boxes in the main CellProfiler window, which changes their values in
% handles.Current. Therefore, handles.Current is most likely where you
% should retrieve this information if needed within a module.
%   Fields currently in handles.Preferences: PixelSize, FontSize,
% DefaultModuleDirectory, DefaultOutputDirectory,
% DefaultImageDirectory.
%
% handles.Measurements:
%       Everything in handles.Measurements contains data specific to each
% image set analyzed for exporting. It is used by the ExportMeanImage
% and ExportCellByCell data tools. This substructure is deleted at the
% beginning of the analysis run (see 'Which substructures are deleted
% prior to an analysis run?' below).
%    Note that two types of measurements are typically made: Object
% and Image measurements.  Object measurements have one number for
% every object in the image (e.g. ObjectArea) and image measurements
% have one number for the entire image, which could come from one
% measurement from the entire image (e.g. ImageTotalIntensity), or
% which could be an aggregate measurement based on individual object
% measurements (e.g. ImageMeanArea).  Use the appropriate prefix to
% ensure that your data will be extracted properly. It is likely that
% Subobject will become a new prefix, when measurements will be
% collected for objects contained within other objects. 
%       Saving measurements: The data extraction functions of
% CellProfiler are designed to deal with only one "column" of data per
% named measurement field. So, for example, instead of creating a
% field of XY locations stored in pairs, they should be split into a
% field of X locations and a field of Y locations. It is wise to
% include the user's input for 'ObjectName' or 'ImageName' as part of
% the fieldname in the handles structure so that multiple modules can
% be run and their data will not overwrite each other.
%   Example fields in handles.Measurements: ImageCountNuclei,
% ObjectAreaCytoplasm, FilenameOrigBlue, PathnameOrigBlue,
% TimeElapsed.
%
% Which substructures are deleted prior to an analysis run?
%       Anything stored in handles.Measurements or handles.Pipeline
% will be deleted at the beginning of the analysis run, whereas
% anything stored in handles.Settings, handles.Preferences, and
% handles.Current will be retained from one analysis to the next. It
% is important to think about which of these data should be deleted at
% the end of an analysis run because of the way Matlab saves
% variables: For example, a user might process 12 image sets of nuclei
% which results in a set of 12 measurements ("ImageTotalNucArea")
% stored in handles.Measurements. In addition, a processed image of
% nuclei from the last image set is left in the handles structure
% ("SegmNucImg"). Now, if the user uses a different module which
% happens to have the same measurement output name "ImageTotalNucArea"
% to analyze 4 image sets, the 4 measurements will overwrite the first
% 4 measurements of the previous analysis, but the remaining 8
% measurements will still be present. So, the user will end up with 12
% measurements from the 4 sets. Another potential problem is that if,
% in the second analysis run, the user runs only a module which
% depends on the output "SegmNucImg" but does not run a module that
% produces an image by that name, the module will run just fine: it
% will just repeatedly use the processed image of nuclei leftover from
% the last image set, which was left in handles.Pipeline.

fieldname = ['ImageAreaOccupied', ObjectName];
handles.Measurements.(fieldname)(handles.Current.SetBeingAnalyzed) = {AreaOccupied};

%%% Saves the Threshold value to the handles structure.
