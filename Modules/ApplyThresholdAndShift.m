%%%%% DISPLAYING AND SAVING PROCESSED IMAGES 
%%%%% PRODUCED BY THIS IMAGE ANALYSIS MODULE:
%%%%% Note: Images saved using the boxes in the main CellProfiler window
%%%%% will be saved in the default directory specified in STEP 1.
%%%%% .
%%%%% If you want to save other processed images, open the m-file for this 
%%%%% image analysis module, go to the line in the
%%%%% m-file where the image is generated, and there should be 2 lines
%%%%% which have been inactivated.  These are green comment lines that are
%%%%% indented. To display an image, remove the percent sign before
%%%%% the line that says "figure, imshow...". This will cause the image to
%%%%% appear in a fresh display window for every image set. To save an
%%%%% image to the hard drive, remove the percent sign before the line
%%%%% that says "imwrite..." and adjust the file type and appendage to the
%%%%% file name as desired.  When you have finished removing the percent
%%%%% signs, go to File > Save As and save the m file with a new name.
%%%%% Then load the new image analysis module into the CellProfiler as
%%%%% usual.
%%%%% Please note that not all of these imwrite lines have been checked for
%%%%% functionality: it may be that you will have to alter the format of
%%%%% the image before saving.  Try, for example, adding the uint8 command:
%%%%% uint8(Image) surrounding the image prior to using the imwrite command
%%%%% if the image is not saved correctly.
