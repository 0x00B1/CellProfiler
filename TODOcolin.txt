Colin's TODO list

(Anne 2-14-06 URGENT) - (more URGENT than the other stuff!)  :)
Can you fix this bug in histogram tool: I am trying to use the thresholding value. I am using the Jason MitHits file: \\gobo\sabatini3_ata\FIGURES\Figure2-validationPhenotypes\2006_02_13_MitosisHits\2006_2_14_1100MitHitsOUT.mat
I am trying to do a histogram of Nuc AreaShape Eccentricity. Then the settings are:
1
8
b
30
auto
auto
no 
>=
[Next page]
22
relative
no
no
image
yes
p
line
yes
Then I pick Nuc Intens Blue, Integrated INtensity. For some reason it then asks me to the name the file (which I didn't ask to save). I click Ok and it says saving did not work. After closing that warning, my figure pops up displaying the first histogram but yielding this error:
??? Error while evaluating uimenu Callback.

??? Error using ==> set
Cell array of strings may only contain string and numeric matrices.

??? Error using ==> set
Invalid cell array of strings.

Error in ==> Histogram at 569
        set(get(h,'XLabel'),'String',{MeasurementToExtract;AdditionalInfoForTitle})

??? Error while evaluating uimenu Callback.

(Anne 2-9-06 URGENT) - Please modify the IdentifyPrimManual so that after each clicking/identification step, the user has the choice of clicking/identifying another object within the image or continuing on in the pipeline. This would allow them to identify an unlimited number of objects per image, rather than just one.

(Anne 2-9-06 URGENT) - There is a weird bug in the IdentifyPrimManual in the pipeline I put in the Dev. DropBox (temp1PIPE.mat, which goes with slide3-1.tif) I usually try to outline a cell with ~10 clicks in a circular shape and it fails but does not give much of an error msg.

(Anne 2-9-06) Usually I name (in an IdentifyPrimAutomatic module) the outlines so they can later be overlaid on an image. When I type in the name in IdentifyPrimAutomatic and then go to the OverlayOutlines module, the new outlines name is not selectable. If I go back and click on the outlines name again and press enter and then go back to OverlayOutlines, it finally shows up. So it seems like some sort of little bug.

(Anne 2-21-06) The timer says Number of cycles completed = 7 of 8 when it's in the middle of processing the 7th cycle (i/e/ number 7 is not yet completed). It's ok to leave the calculation as is and just change the text to say Cycle being processed = 7 of 8.

-There are some problems with the Help Menus.

- Colin, I made a ton of changes to identify modules so they all produce outlines consistently. Could you please check that they all still work with overlay outlines?

- (Requested by Anne 9-21-05) - We haven't tested these modules in a *very* long time - so we should try them out & make sure they work!
