Mike's TODO list

- Anne 12/16 - Put folders for all of your projects so far on sabatini3_ata (our new server). These all should have the same format 2005_12_16_ProjectName so we can keep things straight. I will move my projects there too. I'd move everything from the local computers (G5's and PC) there and put them in a folder for deletion on the desktop of those computers and when we are sure that server is being backed up we can delete the local copies. This will allow us to easily share data, keep projects straight, work on our projects from any of our computers, and have the data backed up (the G5's and PC are not backed up so if they die all your data is gone!).

- Anne 12/16 - Set up the CellProfilerG5 computer (IN han's room) to access all our servers, using either the Wiki GUI instructions or the instructions that Nate might email you. We need to set up groups/users on the computer itself and meanwhile he is setting up the servers to allow that computer to access them. I guess we can assume he has done his thing already, but if it seems to not be working we might ask him if he has given our the CP G5 a static address yet and given it permission to access the servers.  If you get command line instructions from Nate, add them to the Wiki.

- Anne 12/15 - SBS image set: Need fresh data for dose response chart for Wortmannin only (like David's ppt slide). just need the excel data. Also, need supplemental table of the Z and V factors for any measure whose Z FACTOR is above 0.5. For this, we need to make sure we have the full measure name (e.g. which compartment, etc). Also, we need the final image set and PIPE to be zipped and put online as an example (if we are sure it's final).

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the Compile wizard instructions are up to date now.

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the instructions for uploading the cp website to jura are up to date now.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- For some reason the HelpProgrammingNotes do not scroll properly in the text display box - there is no way to scroll in small enough increments to see all the text. I think this is our longest text file so maybe that's why it behaves strangely.

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.
