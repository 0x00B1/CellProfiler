Anne:
Programming:
- Fill in blanks in license blocks, describing files: [BETA]
     % The Original Code is the _______________________.
- Polish all modules, remove image saving code. Use M lint feature? [BETA]
- Move Help and license code to the top of the module's code and format properly.
- IdentifyPrimAdaptiveThresholdB5: Threshold adjustment factor doesn't do anything. [BETA]
- %Mitotic measurement for Jason - add to measure module. % positive phospho H3 cells, using user-specified threshold.
- Histograms - allow fewer decimals; display data on image: all need to use user data, not global.  See compressed histograms for examples. [BETA]
- For identify modules: save the threshold that was used to the handles.
- View in grid Layout button: use normalization button as a guide. [BETA]
- Export cell by cell: resulting data file doesn't fit into the number of columns Excel allows!  Allow user to choose the number and range of images to export.  Make the file have the number of cells be in rows? Make a new button that changes things back to the old way so cell by cell is in columns.  Allow user to choose what's in rows and what's in columns, and notify them at that time that excel = 256 col, 65K rows. [BETA]
- Allow data display of a single parameter across the entire image set, with stdev optionally shown as error bars (MC has error bar code), plus 2D scatterplot of 2 parameters. [BETA]
- 'Start job midway' module, run image set #XXXX (allow putting in a bunch of comma-delimited numbers to allow random), every 50th.
- Spot Identifier for Doug: Figure out Excel mac vs Pc problems.  Allow asking if numbers are in rows or columns.  Check offsets, flipping. Display value only when clicking. Make manual page. Toggle several images.
- Compressed histograms: Add Y sample labels, allow to show relative brightness, allow to put in order by mean, change # of sig figs.  See hist2 at MC to smooth histograms.  Eventually allow histograms to be interactively updated? See automatic updated plot at MC, and also fancyplot.
- Image Tiler: Main GUI's error catching is causing problems when sample info is loaded.  Allow zoom in on thumbnail: get filename (GET COORDINATES) and display high res image.  Needs error catching for images to be the same size.  Display window stays open. See tooltips code. Make manual page.
- Does xlswrite function help?
- Allow to extract illumination image from an output file.
- DNA content histograms: Plan real experiment; Coulter vs. imaging, lots of controls, FACS for phospho-staining intensity.
- Make DNA content/cell cycle histograms for Steve's images

Other:
- Edit rough draft of manual, make pdf, link to website, add web counter, go live w/ beta testers' website. [BETA]
- Install Analysis Toolpak for Excel.
- Send slides to Applied Precision when Doug has prepared them.
- Consult for Definiens manual?
- Call Mathworks and fix individual license (waiting for Fran)
- Improve cluster performance: save mat files in pieces, preallocate, fetching corr illum images? 
- After running Fly135 analysis: calculate cdf (cumsum applied to hist), normalize, KS statistic, mode, Kollback Liebler.  TWO WEEKS FROM NOW: MASSIVE STATISTICAL MEETING: Staining intensity strategy and 5x vs 40x: Discuss with Ray & Polina. Calculate the SD or CV of 5x and 40x 10 image set data. Determine the value of hits from the ~8 large data sets in order to calculate SNR or S/B. Clear off hard drive when done. Analyze new Fly115 untreated data. Look at cell cycle data as compressed histograms using cluster/treeview
- Announce MPL on website and describe how to send money (waiting for TTO)
- Advertise for programmers.
- Organize image analysis validation at SBS (later)
- Make a sample image set and settings file and output file.

Ray:
   Test "clear functions" in parallel code. [BETA]

   Move measurements to handles.Measurements

   Move Settings (other than algorithms and variables) to
     handles.Settings
  
   Move Pipeline and temporary variables to handles.Pipeline

   * Make saving go faster for cluster jobs 
   
   * Describe how to set up cluster jobs in the manual [BETA]
  
   * Write propagate paper :)

   * Have local CP code copied to the cluster ??

   * Have lasterr tell us which line number is involved

Ray(Long-term)
Think about statistical analysis/normalization
Implement elliptical distance transform for HeLa cells
Figure out how to run a lot of module combinations/settings in one batch so that the best one can be chosen (by eye or automatically).
Allow figures to be viewed during analysis when running on cluster (optional, but nice)
Improving/understanding illumination correction and adaptive thresholding (division/rescaling). (For now, use DivideAll Mean.) Especially, fix Adaptive thresholding D5 (wasn't sure what kind of thresholding to allow). Can we make the nuc. Distance module use adaptive thresholding, or is it equivalent to using an "each" corr. Illum or adapthisteq? Improve segmentation between background and cell edges: propagate uses a simple threshold, and watershed uses watershed.  Could maybe use adaptive threshold. Which is better?
Improve cell segmentation. Can we/do we want to  make the propagate function have a user-specified neighborhood size?
All modules: look for speed improvements (esp. imresize?)
Describe all variables and give ranges
Make all modules parameter-free :)
Adapt our output to feed into Whitehead's WADE genome-wide database (maybe not?)
Texture measurement
Implement a trous wavelet segmentation algorithm from a paper Anne found (?)
Compile CellProfiler into Matlab-free version, using Release 14 - check compiler instructions, because some functions are guaranteed not to work, like uisave.
Look at Matlab central to see if any of these are useful/faster than what we have: auto image registration using mutual information (x2), Graph analysis toolbox, multivariate analysis multispectral,


In Han:
   Move Algorithms and Variables to arrays, and to handles.Settings
      substructure  (in VariableArrayBranch) [BETA, Anne thinks]

   Refine List box [BETA]
   
   Fix close/open figure button [BETA]

   Add scroll bar interface to allow > 11 variables

   "Make projection" module (= average, get code from DivideAllMean). Did In Han finish this already?  If so, make a manual page.

   RGB to Grayscale module

   Rescale intensity image (stretch histogram)

 
Anyone:

General:
- Parse out Algorithm revision numbers and store them in the output file

- Interactive zoom button (within Show Image button):
(1) It seems to always work OK the first time you click on Interactive Zoom.  The subsequent times you click on it though: sometimes it works just fine and other times there is no change to the image itself - it stays at fully zoomed out and doesn't respond to mouse clicks.  Perhaps related, sometimes lots of errors are spit out at the command line (I think only on subsequent tries to use the functionality).  Actually, maybe it has something to do with having other figure windows open at the same time?
(2) Once things are working, I would like to add this Interactive Zoom button to several other places: In CellProfiler.m: "Display data on image", "Show pixel data", and all of the figure display windows (for each algorithm - I am not sure whether buttons will stay intact, though, once each algorithm runs. so I am not sure whether it makes more sense to have the button added within each algorithm's code or within the main CellProfiler code when the window is first created). The most important thing is to add the button to "AlgImageTiler.m"; that is why I acquired this code in the first place.- Calculations for display purposes only: surround by an if that is: "If figure window is open OR saveimage = Yes, then do these calculations."
- Timer: Have the time for first set separate from the time for subsequent sets.
- Consistent color of helpdlg, warndlg, msgbox: requires getting the handle then setting the color.
- ImageJ plugins: allow them to be run through CellProfiler
- Binucleate cells: figure out how to identify and count them

Modules to begin:
- Align/resize stack of images (like yeast plates). See Matlab demo on image registration. Did Chris already do this?
- Make a "send email" module that makes Matlab send an email to you after a user-specified number of algorithms have been processed (e.g. after the first, or last, or every 1000 image sets) (see sendmail: built in matlab function?)  Need to enter an email address and have a flexible way to take in when you want the email sent.  (e.g. BOX1: After first?, BOX2: After last?, BOX3: every X number of sets, BOXES4-9: after image # X, BOX11: email address.)
- coloc3D: Adapt this code (from Matlab Central) into CellProfiler
- Adapt all Matlab image functions into modules?
- "Load images from OME" module.
- Nuclear intensity module, using distance transform for watershedding.
- Allow applying a metric to the data after histogramming: e.g. % of cells between range X and Y.
- Allow user to mark images as interesting or not > show control side by side (1-4 at a time) and add that assessment to the data structure. Maybe allow randomizing (to do blind tests). Allow clicking through.
- Quality control:  does hardware tests, e.g. check evenness of illumination, linearity of exposure time, lampchecks, etc. (Get code from Ray). Correct periodicity modules.
- Yeast aggregate classification for Tiago in Lindquist lab.
- Allow sample info to be added after an output file is created; change the display window to have a scroll bar (maybe), MC has code for "General selection dialogs".
- Allow restarting a messed up job that is partway through.

Analyze Test Image button: 
- When test image is chosen using Browse or by typing in, make the selection in the list box match the test image's name.  When typing in, make the list box be reloaded.
- Adapt from Analyze all Images button: no loop, no cancel function, use the files that the user selected: has to be a set of images rather than a single image.  Need to allow > 1 image to be highlighted in list box.
- Figure out how to overlay images and toggle back and forth. Maybe try a new GUI that has a toggle button of some kind, that lets you drag images into the window?  See Inca and dragndrop in MC.

Final polishing/minor wishes:
- Maybe try desGUIDE to eliminate GUIDE .fig file: supposedly faster and less platform dependent?
- showregions at Matlab Central might be useful for Spotfire-like Interactivity
- would be nice for save settings button to automatically add SET to the name > can't currently do it with uisave.
- When there are large numbers of images in a folder, the response of uigetfile is really slow.  Can fix?
- Annotate which modules work for grayscale vs color.
- Write out help windows for each module.
- Website/manuals.  See Matdoc at MC to generate online help.
- Show example cell types and suggested settings.
* Make sure Cellprofiler GUI file is understandable; compact & streamline the code. Use M lint feature.
* Make help windows and error boxes come to the middle of the CellProfiler window.
* Put drawnows in everywhere
* PC: Font size too big.
- Have image windows pay attention to aspect ratio of images.
- Prevent clicking pause/cancel buttons twice.
- Add error catching in each module for the type of input expected for the variables (e.g. must be a number, must be a string, must be within a certain range.)
- Make sure online help matches the manual.
- Create a developer's template algorithm with all the instructions for how to write new modules.

Testing:
- Reproducibility: two image scans of the same spot, two spots on the same slide, two spots on different slides prepared the same day, two spots on different slides prepared different days.
- Dependence of measurements on cell density.

Try other cell segmentation strategies: (?)
* ESPECIALLY: make watershed for bright lines and watershed for dark lines.
* Make new one, same as Cell_Segment17 except try method 2 for background marking.
* Cell_Segment13, I think, has stringent edges because they are based only on the gradient image; does not have second watershedding step.  Should edit and save this as a real algorithm.
* I think Cell_Segment14-16 are intermediates which can be discarded.
* Edit and save Cell_Segment9 as a real algorithm.
* Edit and save Cell_Segment10 as a real algorithm. (background = SKIZ). Try to make a new improved algorithm with SKIZ being smoothed: it seems like it should work better than it did.
* Cell_Segment11 is just 13 without background being thrown out properly, so it can be discarded I think.
* Edit and save Cell_Segment12 as a real algorithm (watershed the original image rather than the gradient image.)
* Should I try a distance transform for the cell segmentation?
