CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
November 21, 2005

- Mike should do >> Edit HelpCPInstallGuide for compiled versions.

(Requested by Anne 12-05-05) - Here are the only other things on the module_checks list to do:
Anne - doublecheck CalcStatistics
Anne - doublecheck CreateBatchSCripts (see susan's help)
Anne - doublecheck MergeBatchOutput, esp that data is exportable.
Someone - check all LoadImages options

(Requested by Anne 12-07-05)  Can we add "Help for image tools" to the CP image tools menu that appears as a result of CPfigure on each figure window, which would pop up the same help window as in the main GUI (Help>Image tools help)?

---------------------------------------------------
JUST PRIOR TO PUBLIC RELEASE:
- ANNE WILL DO>>> Prepare updated manual
- ANNE WILL DO>>> Make reference sheet with short descriptions of the modules (see manuscript table).
- For each common application (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and cell type (e.g. human, yeast, drosophila), make an example pipeline file and a nice pdf document showing the results: We should use the 'test mode' option in IdentifyPrimAutomatic to show all the possibilities, and then show results from the ideal pipeline. This will give people a good starting place for their images. Anne has example images and starting points for new pipelines in the ExampleFlyImages folder.
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.
- tell the following sites that review and list software:
www.zdnet.com	downloads.mycomputer.com	www.windows95.sk
directory.google.com	www.libpng.org	cn.tech.yahoo.com
www.dmoz.org	softload.narod.ru	www.chinabyte.com
www.winsite.com	www.cheta.net www.open-bio.org    caBIG
- Get the email addresses of all corresponding authors from all the research articles Anne has collected, and also microscope facility directors and send them an email telling them to visit cellprofiler.org and sign up for the email list if desired.
- The Broad institute has done a lot of thinking and infrastructure for distributing free software. They have narrowed down to 3 licenses (GPL, a variant of academic open source, and one other) that their scientists use and they also have pages to help register users who download their software etc. this might be useful for us.
- Send copy of software to people in communist countries:

Dear Miss Carpenter:
    Say hello to you first.I am a student from HangZhou--A beautiful city in China. I study
the analysis of cell micrograph, I saw you and your colleagues' great work on CellProfiler Project.I am eager for the CellProfiler Tm,acoording to the profier(pdf), It seems that the matlab version is very suitabale for all of people such as a beginner like me,so if allowable, I ask for a copy of the software.It is of no convenience cause that we can not get in the website of www.cellprofiler.org from China.Thanks very much!
