% Help for the Identify Primary Adaptive Threshold B module: 
%
% This image analysis module identifies objects by applying an
% adaptive threshold to a grayscale image.  Four different methods
% (A,B,C, and D) of adaptive thresholding can be used to identify
% objects.  Applies a local threshold at each pixel across the image
% and then identifies objects which are not touching. Provides more
% accurate edge determination and slightly better separation of clumps
% and than a simple threshold; still, it is ideal for well-separated
% nuclei.
%
% Method B: the optimal thresholds are determined by averaging
% intensities and multiplying by an offset, within the neighborhood of
% every pixel.
%
% NEIGHBORHOOD SIZE: should be set large enough that every square
% block of pixels is likely to contain some background and some
% foreground. Smaller neighborhood sizes take less processing time.
%
% What does Primary mean? Identify Primary modules identify objects
% without relying on any information other than a single grayscale
% input image (e.g. nuclei are typically primary objects). Identify
% Secondary modules require a grayscale image plus an image where
% primary objects have already been identified, because the secondary
% objects' locations are determined in part based on the primary
% objects (e.g. cells can be secondary objects). Identify Tertiary
% modules require images where two sets of objects have already been
% identified (e.g. nuclei and cell regions are used to define the
% cytoplasm objects, which are tertiary objects).
