% CLOSE ALL FIGURES AND TIMERS: 
% Click this button to close all open figure/image windows and timers.
% The main CellProfiler window and any error/message windows will
% remain open. You will be asked for confirmation first before the
% windows are all closed.

% FILE LIST WINDOW:
% There is a window which displays the files in the folder of images
% to be analyzed.  This allows you to check file names or look at the
% order of images from within CellProfiler.  Selecting file names in
% this list does not actually do anything.
