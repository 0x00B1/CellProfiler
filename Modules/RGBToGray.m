function handles = AlgRGBToGray(handles)

% Help for the RGB To Gray module: 
% Category: Pre-processing
%
% Takes an RGB image and converts it to grayscale.  Each color's
% contribution to the final image can be adjusted independently.
%
% Settings:
%
% Adjustment factors: Leaving the adjustment factors set to 1 will
% balance all three colors equally in the final image, which will
% use the same range of intensities as the incoming image.  To weight
% colors relative to each other, the adjustment factor can be
% increased (to increase the weighting) or decreased (to decrease the
% weighting).
%
% SAVING IMAGES: The grayscale image produced by this module can be
% easily saved using the Save Images module, using the names you
% assign. If you want to save other intermediate images, alter the
% code for this module to save those images to the handles structure
% (see the SaveImages module help) and then use the Save Images
% module.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HELP:
% The first unbroken block of lines will be extracted as help by
% CellProfiler's 'Help for this analysis module' button as well as
% Matlab's built in 'help' and 'doc' functions at the command line. It
% will also be used to automatically generate a manual page for the
% module. An example image demonstrating the function of the module
% can also be saved in tif format, using the same name as the
% algorithm (minus Alg), and it will automatically be included in the
% manual page as well.  Follow the convention of: purpose of the
% module, description of the variables and acceptable range for each,
% how it works (technical description), info on which images can be 
% saved, and See also CAPITALLETTEROTHERALGORITHMS. The license/author
% information should be separated from the help lines with a blank
% line so that it does not show up in the help displays.  Do not
% change the programming notes in any modules! These are standard
% across all modules for maintenance purposes, so anything
% module-specific should be kept separate.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW:
% The 'drawnow' function allows figure windows to be updated and
% buttons to be pushed (like the pause, cancel, help, and view
% buttons).  The 'drawnow' function is sprinkled throughout the code
% so there are plenty of breaks where the figure windows/buttons can
% be interacted with.  This does theoretically slow the computation
% somewhat, so it might be reasonable to remove most of these lines
% when running jobs on a cluster where speed is important.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% VARIABLE BOXES AND TEXT: 
% The '%textVAR' lines contain the text which is displayed in the GUI
% next to each variable box. The '%defaultVAR' lines contain the
% default values which are displayed in the variable boxes when the
% user loads the algorithm. The line of code after the textVAR and
% defaultVAR extracts the value that the user has entered from the
% handles structure and saves it as a variable in the workspace of
% this algorithm with a descriptive name. The syntax is important for
% the %textVAR and %defaultVAR lines: be sure there is a space before
% and after the equals sign and also that the capitalization is as
% shown.  Don't allow the text to wrap around to another line; the
% second line will not be displayed.  If you need more space to
% describe a variable, you can refer the user to the help file, or you
% can put text in the %textVAR line above or below the one of
% interest, and do not include a %defaultVAR line so that the variable
% edit box for that variable will not be displayed; the text will
% still be displayed. CellProfiler is currently being restructured to
% handle more than 11 variable boxes. Keep in mind that you can have
% several inputs into the same box: for example, a box could be
% designed to receive two numbers separated by a comma, as long as you
% write a little extraction algorithm that separates the input into
% two distinct variables.  Any extraction algorithms like this should
% be within the VARIABLES section of the code, at the end.

%%% Reads the current algorithm number, since this is needed to find 
%%% the variable values that the user entered.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DISPLAYING RESULTS:
% Each module checks whether its figure is open before calculating
% images that are for display only. This is done by examining all the
% figure handles for one whose handle is equal to the assigned figure
% number for this algorithm. If the figure is not open, everything
% between the "if" and "end" is ignored (to speed execution), so do
% not do any important calculations here. Otherwise an error message
% will be produced if the user has closed the window but you have
% attempted to access data that was supposed to be produced by this
% part of the code. If you plan to save images which are normally
% produced for display only, the corresponding lines should be moved
% outside this if statement.

fieldname = ['figurealgorithm',CurrentAlgorithm];
ThisAlgFigureNumber = handles.(fieldname);
if any(findobj == ThisAlgFigureNumber) == 1;
% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW BEFORE FIGURE COMMAND:
% The "drawnow" function executes any pending figure window-related
% commands.  In general, Matlab does not update figure windows until
% breaks between image analysis modules, or when a few select commands
% are used. "figure" and "drawnow" are two of the commands that allow
% Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window- related
% commands (like zooming, or pressing timer pause or cancel buttons or
% pressing a help button.)  If the drawnow command is not used
% immediately prior to the figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber) line, then
% immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands that
% have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then, when
% Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line, the
% figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one. This
% results in strange things like the subplots appearing in the timer
% window or in the wrong figure window, or in help dialog boxes.
    drawnow
    %%% Sets the width of the figure window to be appropriate (half width).
    if handles.setbeinganalyzed == 1

%%% SAVE DATA TO HANDLES STRUCTURE %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
%       In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent
% function (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see'
% variables produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared
% from one module to the next, they must be saved to what is called
% the 'handles structure'. This is a variable, whose class is
% 'structure', and whose name is handles. Data which should be saved
% to the handles structure within each module includes: any images,
% data or measurements which are to be eventually saved to the hard
% drive (either in an output file, or using the SaveImages module) or
% which are to be used by a later module in the analysis pipeline. Any
% module which produces or passes on an image needs to also pass along
% the original filename of the image, named after the new image name,
% so that if the SaveImages module attempts to save the resulting
% image, it can be named by appending text to the original file name.
% handles.Pipeline is for storing data which must be retrieved by other modules.
% This data can be overwritten as each image set is processed, or it
% can be generated once and then retrieved during every subsequent image
% set's processing, or it can be saved for each image set by
% saving it according to which image set is being analyzed.
%       Anything stored in handles.Measurements or handles.Pipeline
% will be deleted at the end of the analysis run, whereas anything
% stored in handles.Settings will be retained from one analysis to the
% next. It is important to think about which of these data should be
% deleted at the end of an analysis run because of the way Matlab
% saves variables: For example, a user might process 12 image sets of
% nuclei which results in a set of 12 measurements ("TotalNucArea")
% stored in the handles structure. In addition, a processed image of
% nuclei from the last image set is left in the handles structure
% ("SegmNucImg"). Now, if the user uses a different algorithm which
% happens to have the same measurement output name "TotalNucArea" to
% analyze 4 image sets, the 4 measurements will overwrite the first 4
% measurements of the previous analysis, but the remaining 8
% measurements will still be present. So, the user will end up with 12
% measurements from the 4 sets. Another potential problem is that if,
% in the second analysis run, the user runs only an algorithm which
% depends on the output "SegmNucImg" but does not run an algorithm
% that produces an image by that name, the algorithm will run just
% fine: it will just repeatedly use the processed image of nuclei
% leftover from the last image set, which was left in the handles
% structure ("SegmNucImg").
%       Note that two types of measurements are typically made: Object
% and Image measurements.  Object measurements have one number for
% every object in the image (e.g. ObjectArea) and image measurements
% have one number for the entire image, which could come from one
% measurement from the entire image (e.g. ImageTotalIntensity), or
% which could be an aggregate measurement based on individual object
% measurements (e.g. ImageMeanArea).  Use the appropriate prefix to
% ensure that your data will be extracted properly.
%       Saving measurements: The data extraction functions of
% CellProfiler are designed to deal with only one "column" of data per
% named measurement field. So, for example, instead of creating a
% field of XY locations stored in pairs, they should be split into a field
% of X locations and a field of Y locations. Measurements must be
% stored in double format, because the extraction part of the program
% is designed to deal with that type of array only, not cell or
% structure arrays. It is wise to include the user's input for
% 'ObjectName' as part of the fieldname in the handles structure so
% that multiple modules can be run and their data will not overwrite
% each other.
%       Extracting measurements: handles.Measurements.CenterXNuclei{1}(2) gives
% the X position for the second object in the first image.
% handles.Measurements.AreaNuclei{2}(1) gives the area of the first object in
% the second image.

%%% Saves the Grayscaled image to the handles structure so it can be
%%% used by subsequent algorithms.
fieldname = [GrayscaleImageName];
handles.Pipeline.(fieldname) = GrayscaleImage;

%%% Determines the filename of the image to be analyzed.
fieldname = ['Filename', ImageName];
FileName = handles.Pipeline.(fieldname)(handles.setbeinganalyzed);
%%% Saves the original file name to the handles structure in a
%%% field named after the Grayscale image name.
fieldname = ['Filename', GrayscaleImageName];
handles.Pipeline.(fieldname)(handles.setbeinganalyzed) = FileName;
