Mike's TODO list

Anne 12/19 Yeast SCMD images - process and produce nice figure.

- Anne 12/16 - Put folders for all of your projects so far on sabatini3_ata (our new server). These all should have the same format 2005_12_16_ProjectName so we can keep things straight. I will move my projects there too. I'd move everything from the local computers (G5's and PC) there and put them in a folder for deletion on the desktop of those computers and when we are sure that server is being backed up we can delete the local copies. This will allow us to easily share data, keep projects straight, work on our projects from any of our computers, and have the data backed up (the G5's and PC are not backed up so if they die all your data is gone!).

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the Compile wizard instructions are up to date now.

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the instructions for uploading the cp website to jura are up to date now.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- For some reason the HelpProgrammingNotes do not scroll properly in the text display box - there is no way to scroll in small enough increments to see all the text. I think this is our longest text file so maybe that's why it behaves strangely.

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.
