- (Anne 7/18/06) - When we run large image sets, we usually run an illumination correction pipeline. It would be nice if this pipeline would calculate a suggested 'minimum allowable threshold', to be used in the IdentifyPrim and IdentifySec modules. Right now, we choose it empirically. Actually, displaying/saving a histogram of pixel intensity values across the entire image set would be useful too. Perhaps this will be built into the CorrectIllumCalc_New by Ray, rather than requiring a separate module.

- decide on what normalization is appropriate and build a tool in CellVisualizer to do it so we can feed normalized data into the database.  Note: we have usually been smoothing the pattern across the slide overall. We should also talk to  Robert to figure out the pattern of the printhead and then look at non-smoothed data in relation to printhead position to see whether there are any consistent patterns there.

- Investigate non-parametric population-comparison stats: Kolmogorov-Smirnov vs Kullback-Leibler. Have CellVisualizer calculate them for us and deposit into the database?

- Try clustering based on KS statistics, Fly 5-replicate data.

- Implement Loopy belief propagation for thresholding.

- automated method to find background value when calculating the illumination correction function.

- Figure out how to make texture and shape measures invariant to area and intensity. Many zernikes correlate to area, many textures correlate to mean or integrated intensity.

- Several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance, for the Dros movie in the paper and probably for our images overall. [Anne asked Ola 1/9/06 but he replied he doesn't know why and suggested we change the scale of texture].

dimensional space.

Look at Matlab central to see if any of these are useful/faster than
what we have: auto image registration using mutual information (x2),
