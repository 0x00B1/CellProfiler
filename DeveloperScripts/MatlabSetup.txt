Matlab setupNew license file instructions (not sure if all steps are critical, but it worked in 2005):create the license.dat file in text edit, and copy the SERVER and DAEMON lines from previous year's file. Save it in /Applications/MATLAB7/etcIn terminal, rm /var/tmp/lm_TMW*restart computer with network disconnectedStart Matlab as usual------------------Changing the short username on the computer:Required reconfiguring the MATLANLmgr in /Library/StartupItems following its embedded instructions.------------------Upgrading to new version of Matlab instructions:The instructions are here:https://web.mit.edu/ist/products/vsls/matlab/download.html(which is only viewable in Netscape, because it's a secure site), but I have copied most of the relevant info into this note, so there is no need to go to MIT's vsls site. It gives you the option of downloading from MIT's site or Mathworks.  I'd recommend Mathworks because it is more up-to-date. Clicking on Mathworks puts you here:  https://web.mit.edu/ist/products/vsls/matlab/download.html#heading2which has the following instructions for downloading from Mathworks. I have already associated my account with MIT, so I can skip steps 1 & 2 and just go straight to http://www.mathworks.com/accesslogin/ to start step 3:   1.You can create an "Associated User" account with MathWorks to download the products that MIT has licensed. You will need an "Access Login" account and a valid license number to associate your account with the MIT license.  If you do not already have one, create an access login account by going to http://www.mathworks.com/ and click "create account" in the blue navigation bar at the top of the page. Complete and submit the Access Login account form.   2. Associate your access login with the MIT license.         1.      Log in to MathWorks and click "My Account" in the blue navigation bar at the top of the page.         2.  In the "My Licenses" section, click "Associate me with a license."         3.   Click "License User Contact" and enter 191307 (or your concurrent license number) and your e-mail address used for your access login account if prompted.         4.    You should now be associated. MathWorks indicates that it can take up to 24 hours to be associated, but IS&T experience has been that 30 minutes is sufficient.         5.   Logout and log back into MathWorks. (don't skip this step)   3.    Download Products          1.  Click "Download Products & Trials" on the left hand navigation bar.         2.     Click "Download products" in the Professional Version section of Licensed Products. If you get a screen saying that access is not available yet, try logging out and back in to MathWorks.         3.  Follow the onscreen instructions to select and download Matlab and the toolboxes you need.[[[For installing on a laptop that will use an individual (non-network) license:  In the current folder for Matlab, find the license.dat file and copy and paste it into a text file somewhere outside of the Matlab folder. Delete the existing SERVER and DAEMON lines from the file. Use this text when the installer asks you for the license info.  Also, be sure to disconnect your computer from the network prior to step 4. ]]][[[Be sure you have downloaded all the required files, even the ones without .mac extensions. Remove existing Matlab folders from the /Applications folder of the computer and empty the trash (it's a good idea to store a backup copy somewhere). YOU APPARENTLY MUST MOVE THE DOWNLOADED FILES (example list follows):
tbx.images.mactbx.images.commonmatlab.macmatlab.commonboot.ftp
 *INTO* THE matlab_installer FOLDER. ]]]4.    Install Matlab and Toolboxes.  Follow the instructions provided by MathWorks during the download process to install Matlab.------------------In general, to see if there is a problem with the license manager:/Applications/MATLAB6p5/etc/./lmstartif it asks you something, choose yes(optional)   /Applications/MATLAB6p5/etc/.lmstatcdTo then start Matlab:./matlab &(The individual license file is obtained from our software licensing office - be sure to tell them that it is a Mac laptop)To start matlab locally on my laptop using the network license:First, make sure the network license file, located in /Applications/MATLAB6p5/etc,  has the name "license.dat", then launch Matlab using the icon in the dock.(The network license file is obtained from Whitehead's software website, and the server line is added to it from the previous year's license)------------------To start matlab locally on my laptop:First, make sure the individual license file, located in /Applications/MATLAB6p5/etc,  has the name "license.dat", then launch Matlab using the icon in the dock.If you get "Error -15" (files /var/tmp/lm_TMW.vd1 and lm_TMW.ld were not able to be removed), type:rm /var/tmp/lm_TMW.*/Applications/Matlab6p5p1/etc/./lmstartClick the Launch Matlab icon in the dock again.------------------To start matlab remotely, on barra:Use the secure shell to connect to barra:Start X11 programType: ssh -X -l carpente barrapassword = hymnType: vncserver	This will yield a message like "New 'X' desktop is barra:18"Start the VNC Thing program using your regular operating system.When the VNCThing window pops up, type in:barra.wi.mit.edu:n, where n is the number desktop you have been assigned (18 in the example above).Also type in your password (same as above)The X Windows screen should pop up on your desktop > type: matlab &To close remote desktop:Closing your desktop window does not terminate the session!
