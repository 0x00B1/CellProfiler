   Change CellProfiler.m code to preallocate if possible, relating to the following variables (line numbers are approximate).
L 1391 (C 29-40): Array 'Measurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed

   Fix the "FIXME" sections in CellProfiler, unless Ray wanted to do it himself
   

Analyze subdirectories module.


Look into these two bugs reported:
     - The Set Preferences Tab only shows "Set default pixel
       size", and not the other options on page 8 of the manual. So
       the user can not make a CellProfilerPreferences file.  (This is
       probably a platform-specific issue,  reported by Arne
       Heydorn). 

     - Allow the font sizes of GUI elements to be changed for various
            screen resolutions/platforms.  Make this part of
            "SetPreferences"?  Here is the quick fix which may help in
            determining a long term solution: Indeed, the font size is
            a platform/screen resolution issue.  We are working on
            addressing this but it is not straightforward. A quick
            fix, as you mention, is to type 'guide CellProfiler' at
            the command line of Matlab and adjust the font sizes so
            that they look good on your screen.  This involves somehow
            selecting each button/text object (using Select All or by
            clicking on each element) and adjusting the font size in
            View > Property Inspector. Some elements (like the
            module-specific information) must be changed within
            CellProfiler.m. Find the line: 
              set(handles.(['VariableDescription' TwoDigitString(i)]),'visible','off')
            and add this line (replacing the number 8 with whatever
            size is appropriate for your screen): 
              set(handles.(['VariableDescription' TwoDigitString(i)]),'fontsize',8)




As part of the validation work, you might look at:

     - Allow batches of different settings to be run and their results
       compared 

     - Allow automatic selection of settings based on hand-traced images

     - Make separate Identify Secondary modules: one for bright lines
       and one for dark lines between objects.  Also try watershedding
       the gradient image rather than the original. 

     - Improve background/cell edge finding - threshold vs. adaptive
       threshold vs. watershed 

     - Write algorithms to compare hand-traced results to CellProfiler
       results quantitatively, then apply them to our hand-traced data
       sets. 

     - Get someone to Hand-outline a second set of images to compare
       to Chris' set.
