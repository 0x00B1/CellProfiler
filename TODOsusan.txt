Susan's TODO list
FINISH BEFORE LEAVING:


3. CPvalid1 - compare results to Flow cytometry for main CellProfiler publication. 
[you are currently repeating one of the samples after making the settings more similar, I think. When finished, you should do the slide-scale normalization (with Ray's help). Then we should be able to create the final versions of the figures & statistics.]

- NEW FROM ANNE - I am giving you a DVD with some pipelines that need to be salvaged!--Started
1. [NEW FROM ANNE: I have written a DVD with the movie and 3 pipelines (contained within OUT files) that need to be converted to the current version of the software. These are very old pipelines so there are likely to be a *lot* of changes necessary!  I have included a .zip archive of the CellProfiler code at the time these pipelines were made, so it might help you to install this old version of CellProfiler, remove your CellProfilerPreferences.mat file from the Matlab applications folder, set the path of MATLAB to look at this old version (rather than your new trunk version), start this old version of CellProfiler, and load the old pipelines and see what they look like.  I think you should be able to convert the old pipelines while i am gone, and then i can check them when I return.] Dros movie - reprocess the movie using new CPgraythresh and make movie of pixel intensity histogram. Call Victoria to get input. Maybe analyze a second movie: try bioresearch.ucsc.edu? --in progress 

  
- Organize all files, tell Anne where everything is located, polish the protocols for doing everything.

-------------------------
LEAVE FOR LATER:
- Kc 40x data (Fly217-220) - genome-wide screens! 
[Give PIPE to Anne. She will check it and run it later, after CPValid1 project is done and we are sure the exporting to SQL works well.]

- Work with Ray to decide on what normalization is appropriate and build a module in CellProfiler to do the normalization so we can feed normalized data into the database.  Note: we have usually been smoothing the pattern across the slide overall. We should also talk to  Robert to figure out the pattern of the printhead and then look at non-smoothed data in relation to printhead position to see whether there are any consistent patterns there.
