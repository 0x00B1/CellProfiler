Jason's TODO (in rough order of priority):

- (Anne 9/1/06) - The SaveImages module says "The images you have loaded are outside the 0-1 range and you may be losing data" when you feed it colored images (e.g. from the TrackObjects module) make it realize when we are dealing with color object images that are ok to be outside the range? I Haven't been able to reproduce this.

- (Requested by Anne 11-28-05) - Make the expand or shrink module work well with shrinking secondary objects.

- GENERAL MODULE CHECKING: (1) Anne 7-11-06: We should check through the existing error messages in modules, and allow the user a way out if possible. For example, a lot of times a module will error out and cancel processing and say something like "your values were outside the range 0 to 1". Most likely, in that case you would provide a warning dialog that says "You entered a value of -0.5 which is below the minimum value of 0, so the value 0 will be used. Change settings to prevent this error in the future." Make sure that the window doesn't pop up fresh every cycle! (2) I just fixed a bug in LoadImages where if the user typed in 'automatic' in lower case for the two variables (blur and neighborhood suppression) it failed and gave an inexplicable error message. All I had to do was change the strcmp to strcmpi to make it case-insensitive. I think that this is probably a common thing we overlooked. We should go through the code and look for all strcmp and strncmp and replace with the case-insensitive versions strcmpi and strncmpi where appropriate. We don't want to just find and replace all of them because occasionally it might be necessary to be case sensitive! The tool in Matlab Edit > Find Files should be helpful to find all the instances of strcmp in the m files. (3) (Requested by Anne 11-21-05) - Calculations shouldn't be made if they don't need to be (e.g. calculating outlines, colored label matrix for display when the figure is closed anyway). We should check through all the modules.

- Allow CellProfiler to read 3D tif images. I don't have any examples, but probably some can be found online. This is only worth doing if < 1 hours' work.
