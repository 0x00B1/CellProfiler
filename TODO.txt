CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
November 21, 2005

(Requested by Anne 12-01-05) - Mike, check out 'dependency report' (like m lint checker) which points out two things: several 'UNKNOWN' functions which are likely errors in code, and also it points out what toolboxes we are using so that we can see if we are using anything other than the image toolbox.

(Requested by Anne 12-01-05) - Clean up ExportData files and move old versions to outdated. I think the data tool should be called ExportData (not "ToFiles"). Are we going to have a corresponding module(s). right now, it looks like we have WriteSQLfiles as a module - I wanted to check whether this is sharing code with the new ExportData tool and whether it can be expanded to WriteExcelFiles. The module versions should be renamed ExportDataExcel and ExportDataSQL when they are finished up. I assume we need two separate modules because their settings are all different.

-It seems that in several places, like MeasureImageSaturationBlur, we say "Percent" when we actually mean fraction. We should go through all modules/data tools looking for the word percent and make sure that we change it one way or the other so it's accurate & consistent.  Otherwise, if it says 0.08 we don't know whether that is 8% or .08%

-(Mike 11/22 isdeployed) (Requested by Anne 11-21-05)  We need to disable certain buttons/menu items when running the compiled version, e.g. eval, propedit, image tool > Save to workspace and probably other stuff too. What is the command that allows us to determine if we are using compiled code?
TechDiagnosis 		- DONE
SaveCPcode		- DONE
DownloadNewModules	- DONE

(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) Does Display Data on Image work with Ratios,If so, add it as selectable in variable 2. and add it to the see also.

(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) Does FilterBy object measurement work with Neighbors?  If so, add it as selectable in variable 3. and add it to the see also.

(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) I feel pretty strongly that CPretrieveimage should use text as arguments rather than numbers.  E.g. the colorflag should be 'mustbecolor' 'mustbegray' instead of 2 or 3. That way, when you are in a module and look at the line you can figure out what checks it is making. I'm happy to go through and modify this if necessary.

(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) Can we prevent CP main window from being resized? If you click on it during CPresizefigure which is supposed to be operating on one of the other figure windows, it will resize the main GUI!!

(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) Are we using CPlabel2rgb everywhere we ought to? just curious.

(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) TWO OPTIONS TO FIX FONT SIZE FOR TITLES IN ALL FIGURE WINDOWS:
1. For every use of text that's not an image title, be sure to use 'fontsize',handles.Preferences.FontSize.
2. add an argument to CPimagesc: FontSize, passed in as handles.Preferences.FontSize and then add this line to CPimagesc:
set(gca,'fontsize',handles.Preferences.FontSize)

- Make compiled CellProfiler work on cluster

- Check through each module (~2 per day):
EVERYONE:
	- (Requested by Anne) - Test each module on color vs grayscale and make
		sure they all work or have some type of error catching.
THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE FOR ALL:
	- (Requested by Anne 9-01-05) - We'd like to make the variable descriptions
		consistent - at the very least we should try to be consistent with
		stating "Choose" (rather than "select"), and phrasing things as
		questions versus "Enter the ..."   Also, look through the variable
		descriptions for uses of computer-ific words like 'segmentation'.
	- Write help if DNE
	- Check that fontsize is never hard-coded and instead uses the user's preference.
	- Check Font
	- Go through the code looking for instances of the term "image set" and
		replace with "cycle" where appropriate.
	- check format of error messages.
	- CPfigure rather than figure. DataLayout tool in particular is using figure.
	- Smart Indent
	- M Lint error checking
	- CPimagesc
	- Remove 'saving images' text
	- CPwhichmodule
	- CPwhichmodulefigurenumber
---------------------------------------------------
JUST PRIOR TO PUBLIC RELEASE:
- Submit code to Sourceforge for distribution/easy updating? EVeryone seems to recommend this for open-source software.
- Prepare updated manual
- Make reference sheet with short descriptions of the modules (see manuscript table).
- For each common application (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and cell type (e.g. human, yeast, drosophila), make an example pipeline file and a nice pdf document showing the results: We should use the 'test mode' option in IdentifyPrimAutomatic to show all the possibilities, and then show results from the ideal pipeline. This will give people a good starting place for their images. Anne has example images and starting points for new pipelines in the ExampleFlyImages folder.
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.
- copy CP code onto CDs for Colin to take to ASCB meeting in San Francisco.
NO... let's just give people the web address, so they get the freshest copy of the code!  And, it's less work for us!
- tell the following sites that review and list software:
www.zdnet.com	downloads.mycomputer.com	www.windows95.sk
directory.google.com	www.libpng.org	cn.tech.yahoo.com
www.dmoz.org	softload.narod.ru	www.chinabyte.com
www.winsite.com	www.cheta.net www.open-bio.org    caBIG
- Get the email addresses of all corresponding authors from all the research articles Anne has collected, and also microscope facility directors and send them an email telling them to visit cellprofiler.org and sign up for the email list if desired.
- The Broad institute has done a lot of thinking and infrastructure for distributing free software. They have narrowed down to 3 licenses (GPL, a variant of academic open source, and one other) that their scientists use and they also have pages to help register users who download their software etc. this might be useful for us.
- Send copy of software to people in communist countries:

Dear Miss Carpenter:
    Say hello to you first.I am a student from HangZhou--A beautiful city in China. I study
the analysis of cell micrograph, I saw you and your colleagues' great work on CellProfiler Project.I am eager for the CellProfiler Tm,acoording to the profier(pdf), It seems that the matlab version is very suitabale for all of people such as a beginner like me,so if allowable, I ask for a copy of the software.It is of no convenience cause that we can not get in the website of www.cellprofiler.org from China.Thanks very much!
                                                           yours sincerely

POST-PUBLIC RELEASE SUPPORT:
     - Monitor imaging newsgroups and inform people about the software
     - Provide technical support/help desk
     - Fix bugs
     - Maintain for new releases of OS's and Matlab
     - Check Matlab Central for useful code to incorporate into
       CellProfiler or its modules (last checked on 9-16-04:
       Biotech/medical, Graphics (all 3 categories), Image Processing,
       Utilities - GUI Tools & examples, and Misc.) 
     - Organize training workshops
     - Present at conferences, especially microscope facility director-oriented ones.
---------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO DO WHEN NEW VERSIONS OF MATLAB COME OUT:
- update the image file formats that are readable in LoadImages modules. 
- For many functions we have made our own CP versions - check the new matlab code to see if they've changed anything that would warrant us re-creating the CP subfunctions to use the new code.
