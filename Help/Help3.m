function Help3

% FOR HELP ON INDIVIDUAL MODULES: Click the 'Help for this analysis
% module' button towards the right of the CellProfiler window.
%
% IMPORTANT HINT:  For all  image processing applications, the first
% module which must be run is a 'Load Images' module, where you
% specify the identity of the images that you want to analyze.
%
% ADD/REMOVE/MOVE UP/MOVE DOWN BUTTONS: 
% Choose image analysis modules to add to your analysis routine by
% clicking 'Add'.  Properly formatted image analysis modules for
% CellProfiler start with the letters 'Alg' and end with '.m'.
% Modules are always added to the end of the pipeline, but their order
% can be adjusted using the Move up and Move down buttons. The Remove
% button will delete a module from the pipeline.  Clicking an
% algorithm in the pipeline will reveal its settings in the space to
% the right of the selected module.
%
% SHORTCUTS - SAVE SETTINGS: 
% Once you have loaded the desired image analysis modules and modified
% all of the settings as desired, you may save these settings for
% future use by clicking 'Save Settings' and naming the file. This
% creates a small file containing all of the image analysis modules
% and their variables, plus the pixel size.  It does not store the
% sample information or the folder of images to be analyzed.
%
% SHORTCUTS - LOAD SETTINGS: 
% Settings can be loaded from a previously saved settings file or from
% a previously saved output file.  CellProfiler automatically
% determines which type of file you have selected.
