CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
November 21, 2005

MIKE WILL DO>>>> (Requested by Anne 12-01-05) - Clean up ExportData files and move old versions to outdated. I think the data tool should be called ExportData (not "ToFiles"). Are we going to have a corresponding module(s). right now, it looks like we have WriteSQLfiles as a module - I wanted to check whether this is sharing code with the new ExportData tool and whether it can be expanded to WriteExcelFiles. The module versions should be renamed ExportDataExcel and ExportDataSQL when they are finished up. I assume we need two separate modules because their settings are all different.

-It seems that in several places, like MeasureImageSaturationBlur, we say "Percent" when we actually mean fraction. We should go through all modules/data tools looking for the word percent and make sure that we change it one way or the other so it's accurate & consistent.  Otherwise, if it says 0.08 we don't know whether that is 8% or .08%

-(Mike 11/22 isdeployed) (Requested by Anne 11-21-05)  We need to disable certain buttons/menu items when running the compiled version, e.g. eval, propedit, image tool > Save to workspace and probably other stuff too. What is the command that allows us to determine if we are using compiled code?
TechDiagnosis 		- DONE
SaveCPcode		- DONE
DownloadNewModules	- DONE
---------------------------------------------------
JUST PRIOR TO PUBLIC RELEASE:
- ANNE WILL DO>>> Prepare updated manual
- ANNE WILL DO>>> Make reference sheet with short descriptions of the modules (see manuscript table).
- For each common application (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and cell type (e.g. human, yeast, drosophila), make an example pipeline file and a nice pdf document showing the results: We should use the 'test mode' option in IdentifyPrimAutomatic to show all the possibilities, and then show results from the ideal pipeline. This will give people a good starting place for their images. Anne has example images and starting points for new pipelines in the ExampleFlyImages folder.
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.
- tell the following sites that review and list software:
www.zdnet.com	downloads.mycomputer.com	www.windows95.sk
directory.google.com	www.libpng.org	cn.tech.yahoo.com
www.dmoz.org	softload.narod.ru	www.chinabyte.com
www.winsite.com	www.cheta.net www.open-bio.org    caBIG
- Get the email addresses of all corresponding authors from all the research articles Anne has collected, and also microscope facility directors and send them an email telling them to visit cellprofiler.org and sign up for the email list if desired.
- The Broad institute has done a lot of thinking and infrastructure for distributing free software. They have narrowed down to 3 licenses (GPL, a variant of academic open source, and one other) that their scientists use and they also have pages to help register users who download their software etc. this might be useful for us.
- Send copy of software to people in communist countries:

Dear Miss Carpenter:
    Say hello to you first.I am a student from HangZhou--A beautiful city in China. I study
the analysis of cell micrograph, I saw you and your colleagues' great work on CellProfiler Project.I am eager for the CellProfiler Tm,acoording to the profier(pdf), It seems that the matlab version is very suitabale for all of people such as a beginner like me,so if allowable, I ask for a copy of the software.It is of no convenience cause that we can not get in the website of www.cellprofiler.org from China.Thanks very much!
                                                           yours sincerely
