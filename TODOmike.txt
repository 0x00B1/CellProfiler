Mike's TODO list

- New, 6-15-06. Combine Five Biotechniques figures into three by combining Figures 3-5 all together - maybe rotate the lungs in figure 3 90 degrees to give you enough room to put the pipeline at the left.

- add the pipeline to the figure for each application (like we did for Figure 1a).

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES

- Tell people at lab meeting about our storage closet downstairs. I think most people don't know.

- As we discovered, Plate fix in the Crop module works to force the coordinates to be used each time freshly (when doing rectangle, coordinates). Can you describe in the help why/how this works? I guess in my case none of the rows/columns were 50% empty, so the real purpose of Plate fix was thwarted, while the cute side benefit of repeating use of the coordinates was used?
