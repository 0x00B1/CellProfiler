Mike's TODO list

(Anne 2-16) Put figure 5's SBS PIPE and examples on the website as the more typical CNT assay. Also, put all those unzipped example folders into our SVN repository.

(Anne 2-9-06) Please reprocess Fly200, all slides, and deposit data into the database under a new name.
(Anne 2-9-06) Please reprocess NIRHT and deposit data into the database under a new name.

****** Anne 1/7 - MANUSCRIPT FIGURES ******

Figure 2D (G2/M separation)
- For part 2 we hope we Will use jason's suggested mutant and see if we can see an increase in metaphase nuclei. {UPDATE: We have already done a full phenotypic analysis of jason's image set - In Han is setting up CV to access this data and then we can go into the database and look for high p-H3 staining + small nuclei + eccentric nuclei and look for hits and then check the original images to see if they look metaphase arrested.}
[PICK SOMETHING FROM THE NIRHT_4N_nucsize hit list that looks like it has a lot of metaphase nuclei. TEMP COPY of these images are on CP_G5 so you can choose a nice one. We might need to use shape (eccentricity) too - not just nuc size and 4N content. We wrote out two options for displaying - not sure which will be nicer.] [[UPDATE 1-26-06: I think now you have that spot number we found when looking with Ray and that is the image you want to use for this, right?]]

Post all the example images and pipelines at cellprofiler.org

When the manuscript is submitted, *please* move *everything* you've ever processed on the G5's and your PC to its own, dated experiment folder on sabatini3_ata, within a Figure folder if appropriate.

****** END OF MANUSCRIPT PROJECTS ******


Mike 1-31-06: Compile CP for cluster purposes.

FIGURE OUT WHY NUMBERS ARE WEIRD FOR PHOSPHO HISTONE 3 DATA IN DATABASE - e.g. why isn't pH3 staining within the nucleus???

Anne 12/23: I noticed something peculiar in the movie I am analyzing - several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance. Can you check whether this is true for other images, and if it's a bug? [Anne asked Ola 1/9/06]

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES

- Create business cards for yourself! I've put files in Promotional > Business Cards, plus instructions for doing it. For mine, I'd like to keep the format of having WIBR-stuff on the front and CP stuff on the back. You are welcome to create CP-only cards (this is probably better because officially the WIBR doesn't like us to use their logo without getting it approved through the administration which is a pain).  I've got a word file that contains many links to the same business card file - that way you can adjust the business card file for different people or to update contact info, and then just change the link in the word file and it should all update. I bought stiff paper which apparently feeds through laser printers ok - it's on my desk. We have a laser printer in Lahra/David Sabatini's office called SABATINI COLOR you can use, but we should try to minimize how much color ink we use, so making the cards have a white background would be a good idea, and would look nice for the CP logo (for mine, with the WIBR stuff, i think we have to keep it purple background, but for practicing, I'd stick to a white background card). I'm sure we ca n find a paper cutter somewhere (the office above Lahra's on the floor above us).  The spacing of the cards on those template files may be messed up because it's designed for perforated business card paper, but that paper is kind of lame because it leaves little fuzzies on the edges of the cards so i think we are better off using plain card stock and a paper cutter.  Update the instructions if anything changes. I guess we could SVN commit a new card for each person?  or just store a card for each person on your local computer but leave the template untouched. whatever.
