CURRENTLY WORKING ON: (CellProfiler.m)




OTHER TODO'S:

- (Anne 3-21-06) - When DIB images are loaded, the popup window asking you about the size, etc of the images is gray.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Make the error handling consistent for CPsubfunctions. See programming notes - right now many CPsubfunctions use error('') and others use CPErrordlg + return, and we want them to all use error('') which means whichever modules call them need to be changed to handle errors.

- Mike - Add option to change colormap to image tool window

- (Anne 6/12/06) - Load Pipeline fails if a module no longer exists. The code should be modified around line 600 or so. If the module is not found on the matlab path (or in the modules folder on the compiled version), it asks the user to choose a directory where modules are stored, but it does not really consider the possibility that the module just does not exist anymore. So I think there should first be a warning dialog stating that the module can't be found and give the user the choice to choose the module directory (if they do this, the user should also be given a message to be sure to change the default module directory in Set Preferences, I think?) or to abort. I assume there is no graceful way to recover from a missing module? It would be nice to load the remainder of the pipeline to show the user what was there, even though it can't be run or salvaged, as long as the user is apologized to and warned that salvaging is not possible?  Maybe the user could be given the option to choose an alternate module, which would then be loaded with its default settings? A way to practice with fixing this is to go in manually and change one of the module names to something that does not exist.
Also, if you press 'cancel' right now, when it asks for the Pathname (uigetdir), lots of bad things happen.


DONE:

- (Anne 6/12/06) - Should the Timer be renamed "Status"?

- (Anne 6/12/06) - The window that opens when you click Details in the Timer window needs a title in its title bar (I guess "Timer Details" or "Status Details"), and it needs to look decent! Right now none of the columns line up. (Bugs remain)

- (Anne 6/12/06) - It would be so great, when you have tons of windows open, to have under "Windows" on the main menu bar a listing of all open windows in CellProfiler so that you can make any open window you want come to the front. It should list the same info that is in the title bar of the window, including Figure XX: IdentifyPrimAutomatic, for example.

- Anne 6-22-06: There is some strangeness relating to the image tool help. In any of the figures produced during processing, there is "CellProfiler Image Tools" in the menu bar and there is an option "Show Toolbox help". What it really should be called is "ShowHelpForThisMenu". Also, if you choose that option then choose "Show Toolbox help", a bunch of stuff is displayed - make this help file display like the other menu items.

- Anne 6-22-06: In any of the figures produced during processing, there is a problem with "OpenNewImageFile" under the "CellProfiler Image Tools" in the menu bar. If you choose an image, an error results and the image is not displayed. If you make changes to the underlying subfunction, be sure that other features using that subfunction still work.


POSSIBLE TODO'S:

- (Requested by Anne 11-30-05) - Measure Ratios currently does not display anything in the figure window. It might be nice to display the average ratios, as is done for many of the MeasureObject modules.

- (Requested by Anne 11-21-05) - In LoadImages and LoadSingleImage, we have a variable that asks for the file extension and it says "DOesn't work right now". We should make it work!

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- See the developer script for Generate colormaps and have it display in the help window for HelpColormaps. Then alter the help for the various modules that use colormaps to see HelpColormaps for example colormaps.

- (Requested by Colin 1-13-06) - The InteractiveZoom creates an error when the mouse is going over the image, but a different figure it on top.

- (Requested by Anne 12-15-05)- When you click Open Figure (during processing), the figure pops up with a really high figure number. Seems a little strange.
