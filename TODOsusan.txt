Susan's TODO list

- NEW FROM ANNE (long term) - Work with Ray to decide on what normalization is appropriate and build a module in CellProfiler to do the normalization so we can feed normalized data into the database.

- Improve automation of running jobs on the cluster - use some of the pending image sets below to start processing some images to get an idea of what automation we already have and decide what steps to improve.

- Process these image sets:
1. Dros movie - reprocess the movie using new CPgraythresh and make movie of pixel intensity histogram. Call Victoria to get input. Maybe analyze a second movie: try bioresearch.ucsc.edu? 
2. CPvalid1 - compare results to Flow cytometry and Coulter measurements for main CellProfiler publication.
3. Kc 40x data (Fly217-220) - genome-wide screens!

- Automate/check the production of SQL-importable files by CellProfiler:
1. The new WriteSQL module also doesn't match the current ExportSQL2.m Data tool,
which should be changed to use CPConvertSQL.m as well. When everything is finished, we might consider making the ExportSQL2.m function an option in the regular ExportData DataTool.
2. CPConvertSQL automatically creates column names for the DB from the
hierarchy in handles.  Sometimes these column names are too long.
Currently, all it does is print a warning if this happens.  This may
be sufficient, but perhaps it should be more forceful.  In general,
too long names can be fixed just before importing the data.
3. In han and Ray want means and medians to be calculated per image for all object measurements before they come into the database, so we should build this into CellProfiler's code for SQL exporting. We need to coordinate with them the structure/naming system for these derived measurements.

- Research the various options for a database/server (e.g. which are backed up, from where can they be accessed, speed, etc). Set up a database/server locally (currently things are set up on Ray's desktop computer "oblique")

- Learn 5x imaging on the microscope.

- Learn 40x imaging on the microscope.

- Play with data for Fly200 experiments (phospho chips) using CellVisualizer.

- (Long-term): improve the automation of the image acquisition so that choosing and verifying control spots is easier.

- (Long-term): Set up 5x imaging on the Cellomics ArrayScan using their Slideport slide holder - is the 'window' of the slideport big enough to image the entire slide.  Wait for the HCi2005 ArrayScan software upgrade, though.

- (Long-term): Play with the genome-wide data!! Use clustering/bioinformatics tools to look for interesting patterns.

Given on 9/7/2005

--set up SVN on cluster   waiting for login
--week of 9/12 ,  check wth Ray to work on writerSQL module
--week of 9/12, meet with Tim ierson, IT dept. to discuss /set up the mySQL database
-- practice with large batches (FLY200) + use that

--Anne will work together to get real CPValid1 pipeline ready if time allows

--modify the .sh script on cluster(barra) to allow the queue name to be an argument for the "return" script so we don't have 8 or more different copies. change the email adddress in the script to by mine or leave it out.
