Mike's TODO list

- (Requested by Anne) - Adapt MeasureAreaOccupied to use the same threshold options as are in IdentifyPrimAutomatic.  Also, its measurements are not saved in the proper structure format. It looks like this when I analyzed three image cycles:
handles.Measurements
ans = 
             ImageAreaOccupiedStainedRegion: {[156845]  [424211]  [336473]}
    ImageAreaOccupiedThresholdStainedRegion: {[0.0174]  [0.0406]  [0.0290]}
But these measurements should actually be in handles.Measurements.Image in two separate fields - one with the measurements and the other with the feature names, and with these two fields listed above being features.  This should make the module compatible with the MeasureRatios module, so we should then adjust the MeasureRatios module so you can choose these measures.

- (Requested by Anne) - Add a happy dialog box that shows while CellProfiler is loading.  Include the CellProfiler logo, 'CellProfiler is starting up...' text, the authors & contributors, etc.

- Add 'New Pipeline' button

- Ask Anne about bioimage check for how good programs are
