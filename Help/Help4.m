% Help for Image buttons:
% SAVE IMAGE AS: 
% Any image that is displayed can be saved to the hard drive in any
% standard image file format by clicking this button and following the
% instructions.  Type 'imformats' in the command window to see a list
% of acceptable file formats.
%
% SHOW IMAGE: 
% If you want to open and image and display it (for example, in order
% to check the background pixel intensity or to determine pixel
% coordinates, or to check which wavelength it is), click this button.
%
% SHOW PIXEL DATA: 
% If you have an image already displayed in a figure window and would
% like to determine the X, Y position or the intensity at a particular
% pixel, click this button.        
%
% CLOSE ALL FIGURES AND TIMERS: 
% Click this button to close all open figure/image windows and timers.
% The main CellProfiler window and any error/message windows will
% remain open. You will be asked for confirmation first before the
% windows are all closed.
%
% FILE LIST WINDOW:
% There is a window which displays the files in the folder of images
% to be analyzed.  This allows you to check file names or look at the
% order of images from within CellProfiler.  Selecting file names in
% this list does not actually do anything.
