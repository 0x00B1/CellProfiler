% Help for the Identify Primary Adaptive Threshold D module: 
% Category: Object Identification
% 
% This image analysis module identifies objects by applying an
% adaptive threshold to a grayscale image.  Four different methods
% (A,B,C, and D) of adaptive thresholding can be used to identify
% objects.  Applies a local threshold at each pixel across the image
% and then identifies objects which are not touching. Provides more
% accurate edge determination and slightly better separation of clumps
% and than a simple threshold; still, it is ideal for well-separated
% nuclei.
%
% Module D: the optimal thresholds are determined by determining the
% spatially weighted average (Gaussian lowpass) and multiplying by an
% offset, within the neighborhood of every pixel. Possibly comparable
% to the method used by Zeiss KS software.
% 
% Settings:
%
% Size range: You may exclude objects that are smaller or bigger than
% the size range you specify. A comma should be placed between the
% lower size limit and the upper size limit. The units here are pixels
% so that it is easy to zoom in on found objects and determine the
% size of what you think should be excluded.
%
% Threshold (0 to 1, higher = more stringent): In the intermediate
% image titled "Before thresholding" in this module's image display
% window, pixels above the threshold will be counted as part of
% objects and pixels below the threshold will be counted as
% background. A lower threshold will be less stringent, although if
% the value is set too low, the objects become so large they run into
% each other and are counted as a giant object which might be thrown
% out because it is touching the border of the image.  You can see if
% this is happening by displaying the image called ThresholdedImage.
%
% NOTE: THIS MODULE DOES NOT YET ALLOW AUTOMATIC CALCULATION OF
% THRESHOLDS. I am not sure whether it is a good idea to allow one
% anyway.
%
% Neighborhood size (odd number, higher = less stringent): Smaller
% neighborhood sizes will be more prone to producing objects with
% small holes and uneven edges (i.e. it is more prone to noise),
% whereas larger neighborhoods will cause objects to begin merging
% with each other, at least to a certain extent. Smaller neighborhood
% sizes take less processing time.
% 
% Sigma (positive number, higher = less stringent): Sigma affects the
% blurring step, so its behavior can be described in a similar way to
% neighborhood above.  Neighborhood describes how many nearby pixels
% are used for blurring, and sigma determines how much far away pixels
% should affect the blurring.
%
% What does Primary mean? 
% Identify Primary modules identify objects without relying on any
% information other than a single grayscale input image (e.g. nuclei
% are typically primary objects). Identify Secondary modules require a
% grayscale image plus an image where primary objects have already
% been identified, because the secondary objects' locations are
% determined in part based on the primary objects (e.g. cells can be
% secondary objects). Identify Tertiary modules require images where
% two sets of objects have already been identified (e.g. nuclei and
% cell regions are used to define the cytoplasm objects, which are
% tertiary objects).
%
% SAVING IMAGES: This module produces several images which can be
% easily saved using the Save Images module. These will be grayscale
% images where each object is a different intensity. (1) The
% preliminary segmented image, which includes objects on the edge of
% the image and objects that are outside the size range can be saved
% using the name: PrelimSegmented + whatever you called the objects
% (e.g. PrelimSegmentedNuclei). (2) The preliminary segmented image
% which excludes objects smaller than your selected size range can be
% saved using the name: PrelimSmallSegmented + whatever you called the
% objects (e.g. PrelimSmallSegmented Nuclei) (3) The final segmented
% image which excludes objects on the edge of the image and excludes
% objects outside the size range can be saved using the name:
% Segmented + whatever you called the objects (e.g. SegmentedNuclei)
% 
% Several additional images are normally calculated for display only,
% including the colored label matrix image (the objects displayed as
% arbitrary colors), object outlines, and object outlines overlaid on
% the original image. These images can be saved by altering the code
% for this module to save those images to the handles structure (see
% the SaveImages module help) and then using the Save Images module.
% Important note: The calculations of these display images are only
% performed if the figure window is open, so the figure window must be
% left open or the Save Images module will fail.  If you are running
% the job on a cluster, figure windows are not open, so the Save
% Images module will also fail, unless you go into the code for this
% module and remove the 'if/end' statement surrounding the DISPLAY
% RESULTS section.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HELP:
% The first unbroken block of lines will be extracted as help by
% CellProfiler's 'Help for this analysis module' button as well as
% Matlab's built in 'help' and 'doc' functions at the command line. It
% will also be used to automatically generate a manual page for the
% module. An example image demonstrating the function of the module
% can also be saved in tif format, using the same name as the
% algorithm (minus Alg), and it will automatically be included in the
% manual page as well.  Follow the convention of: purpose of the
% module, description of the variables and acceptable range for each,
% how it works (technical description), info on which images can be 
% saved, and See also CAPITALLETTEROTHERALGORITHMS. The license/author
% information should be separated from the help lines with a blank
% line so that it does not show up in the help displays.  Do not
% change the programming notes in any modules! These are standard
% across all modules for maintenance purposes, so anything
% module-specific should be kept separate.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW:
% The 'drawnow' function allows figure windows to be updated and
% buttons to be pushed (like the pause, cancel, help, and view
% buttons).  The 'drawnow' function is sprinkled throughout the code
% so there are plenty of breaks where the figure windows/buttons can
% be interacted with.  This does theoretically slow the computation
% somewhat, so it might be reasonable to remove most of these lines
% when running jobs on a cluster where speed is important.

%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow 

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% VARIABLE BOXES AND TEXT: 
% The '%textVAR' lines contain the text which is displayed in the GUI
% next to each variable box. The '%defaultVAR' lines contain the
% default values which are displayed in the variable boxes when the
% user loads the algorithm. The line of code after the textVAR and
% defaultVAR extracts the value that the user has entered from the
% handles structure and saves it as a variable in the workspace of
% this algorithm with a descriptive name. The syntax is important for
% the %textVAR and %defaultVAR lines: be sure there is a space before
% and after the equals sign and also that the capitalization is as
% shown.  Don't allow the text to wrap around to another line; the
% second line will not be displayed.  If you need more space to
% describe a variable, you can refer the user to the help file, or you
% can put text in the %textVAR line above or below the one of
% interest, and do not include a %defaultVAR line so that the variable
% edit box for that variable will not be displayed; the text will
% still be displayed. CellProfiler is currently being restructured to
% handle more than 11 variable boxes. Keep in mind that you can have
% several inputs into the same box: for example, a box could be
% designed to receive two numbers separated by a comma, as long as you
% write a little extraction algorithm that separates the input into
% two distinct variables.  Any extraction algorithms like this should
% be within the VARIABLES section of the code, at the end.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW BEFORE FIGURE COMMAND:
% The "drawnow" function executes any pending figure window-related
% commands.  In general, Matlab does not update figure windows until
% breaks between image analysis modules, or when a few select commands
% are used. "figure" and "drawnow" are two of the commands that allow
% Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window- related
% commands (like zooming, or pressing timer pause or cancel buttons or
% pressing a help button.)  If the drawnow command is not used
% immediately prior to the figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber) line, then
% immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands that
% have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then, when
% Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line, the
% figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one. This
% results in strange things like the subplots appearing in the timer
% window or in the wrong figure window, or in help dialog boxes.

%%% SAVE DATA TO HANDLES STRUCTURE %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
%       In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent
% function (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see'
% variables produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared
% from one module to the next, they must be saved to what is called
% the 'handles structure'. This is a variable, whose class is
% 'structure', and whose name is handles. Data which should be saved
% to the handles structure within each module includes: any images,
% data or measurements which are to be eventually saved to the hard
% drive (either in an output file, or using the SaveImages module) or
% which are to be used by a later module in the analysis pipeline. Any
% module which produces or passes on an image needs to also pass along
% the original filename of the image, named after the new image name,
% so that if the SaveImages module attempts to save the resulting
% image, it can be named by appending text to the original file name.
%       It is important to think about which of these data should be
% deleted at the end of an analysis run because of the way Matlab
% saves variables: For example, a user might process 12 image sets of
% nuclei which results in a set of 12 measurements ("TotalNucArea")
% stored in the handles structure. In addition, a processed image of
% nuclei from the last image set is left in the handles structure
% ("SegmNucImg"). Now, if the user uses a different algorithm which
% happens to have the same measurement output name "TotalNucArea" to
% analyze 4 image sets, the 4 measurements will overwrite the first 4
% measurements of the previous analysis, but the remaining 8
% measurements will still be present. So, the user will end up with 12
% measurements from the 4 sets. Another potential problem is that if,
% in the second analysis run, the user runs only an algorithm which
% depends on the output "SegmNucImg" but does not run an algorithm
% that produces an image by that name, the algorithm will run just
% fine: it will just repeatedly use the processed image of nuclei
% leftover from the last image set, which was left in the handles
% structure ("SegmNucImg").
%
% INCLUDE FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF MEASUREMENTS PER CELL AND PER IMAGE
% HERE>>>
%
%       Saving measurements: The data extraction functions of
% CellProfiler are designed to deal with only one "column" of data per
% named measurement field. So, for example, instead of creating a
% field of XY locations stored in pairs, it is better to store a field
% of X locations and a field of Y locations. Measurements must be
% stored in double format, because the extraction part of the program
% is designed to deal with that type of array only, not cell or
% structure arrays. It is wise to include the user's input for
% 'ObjectName' as part of the fieldname in the handles structure so
% that multiple modules can be run and their data will not overwrite
% each other.
%
%       Extracting measurements: handles.dMCCenterXNuclei{1}(2) gives
% the X position for the second object in the first image.
% handles.dMCAreaNuclei{2}(1) gives the area of the first object in
% the second image.

%%% Saves the segmented image, not edited for objects along the edges or
%%% for size, to the handles structure.
fieldname = ['dOTPrelimSegmented',ObjectName];
handles.(fieldname) = PrelimLabelMatrixImage1;

%%% Saves the segmented image, only edited for small objects, to the
