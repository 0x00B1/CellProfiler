% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
%       In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent
% function (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see'
% variables produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared
% from one module to the next, they must be saved to what is called
% the 'handles structure'. This is a variable, whose class is
% 'structure', and whose name is handles. The contents of the handles
% structure are printed out at the command line of Matlab using the
% Tech Diagnosis button. The only variables present in the main
% handles structure are handles to figures and gui elements.
% Everything else should be saved in one of the following
% substructures:
%
% handles.Settings:
%       Everything in handles.Settings is stored when the user uses
% the Save pipeline button, and these data are loaded into
% CellProfiler when the user uses the Load pipeline button. This
% substructure contains all necessary information to re-create a
% pipeline, including which modules were used (including variable
% revision numbers), their setting (variables), and the pixel size.
%   Fields currently in handles.Settings: PixelSize, ModuleNames,
% VariableValues, NumbersOfVariables, VariableRevisionNumbers.
%
% handles.Pipeline:
%       This substructure is deleted at the beginning of the
% analysis run (see 'Which substructures are deleted prior to an
% analysis run?' below). handles.Pipeline is for storing data which
% must be retrieved by other modules. This data can be overwritten as
% each image set is processed, or it can be generated once and then
% retrieved during every subsequent image set's processing, or it can
% be saved for each image set by saving it according to which image
% set is being analyzed, depending on how it will be used by other
% modules. Any module which produces or passes on an image needs to
% also pass along the original filename of the image, named after the
% new image name, so that if the SaveImages module attempts to save
% the resulting image, it can be named by appending text to the
% original file name.
%   Example fields in handles.Pipeline: FileListOrigBlue,
% PathnameOrigBlue, FilenameOrigBlue, OrigBlue (which contains the actual image).
%
% handles.Current:
%       This substructure contains information needed for the main
% CellProfiler window display and for the various modules to
% function. It does not contain any module-specific data (which is in
% handles.Pipeline).
%   Example fields in handles.Current: NumberOfModules,
% StartupDirectory, DefaultOutputDirectory, DefaultImageDirectory,
% FilenamesInImageDir, CellProfilerPathname, ImageToolHelp,
% DataToolHelp, FigureNumberForModule01, NumberOfImageSets,
% SetBeingAnalyzed, TimeStarted, CurrentModuleNumber.
%
% handles.Preferences: 
%       Everything in handles.Preferences is stored in the file
% CellProfilerPreferences.mat when the user uses the Set Preferences
% button. These preferences are loaded upon launching CellProfiler.
% The PixelSize, DefaultImageDirectory, and DefaultOutputDirectory
% fields can be changed for the current session by the user using edit
% boxes in the main CellProfiler window, which changes their values in
% handles.Current. Therefore, handles.Current is most likely where you
% should retrieve this information if needed within a module.
%   Fields currently in handles.Preferences: PixelSize, FontSize,
% DefaultModuleDirectory, DefaultOutputDirectory,
% DefaultImageDirectory.
%
% handles.Measurements
%      Data extracted from input images are stored in the
% handles.Measurements substructure for exporting or further analysis.
% This substructure is deleted at the beginning of the analysis run
% (see 'Which substructures are deleted prior to an analysis run?'
% below). The Measurements structure is organized in two levels. At
% the first level, directly under handles.Measurements, there are
% substructures (fields) containing measurements of different objects.
% The names of the objects are specified by the user in the Identify
% modules (e.g. 'Cells', 'Nuclei', 'Colonies').  In addition to these
% object fields is a field called 'Image' which contains information
% relating to entire images, such as filenames, thresholds and
% measurements derived from an entire image. That is, the Image field
% contains any features where there is one value for the entire image.
% As an example, the first level might contain the fields
% handles.Measurements.Image, handles.Measurements.Cells and
% handles.Measurements.Nuclei.
%      In the second level, the measurements are stored in matrices 
% with dimension [#objects x #features]. Each measurement module
% writes its own block; for example, the MeasureAreaShape module
% writes shape measurements of 'Cells' in
% handles.Measurements.Cells.AreaShape. An associated cell array of
% dimension [1 x #features] with suffix 'Features' contains the names
% or descriptions of the measurements. The export data tools, e.g.
% ExportData, triggers on this 'Features' suffix. Measurements or data
% that do not follow the convention described above, or that should
% not be exported via the conventional export tools, can thereby be
% stored in the handles.Measurements structure by leaving out the
% '....Features' field. This data will then be invisible to the
% existing export tools.
%      Following is an example where we have measured the area and
% perimeter of 3 cells in the first image and 4 cells in the second
% image. The first column contains the Area measurements and the
% second column contains the Perimeter measurements.  Each row
% contains measurements for a different cell:
% handles.Measurements.Cells.AreaShapeFeatures = {'Area' 'Perimeter'}
% handles.Measurements.Cells.AreaShape{1} = 	40		20
%                                               100		55
%                                              	200		87
% handles.Measurements.Cells.AreaShape{2} = 	130		100
%                                               90		45
%                                               100		67
%                                               45		22
%
% Which substructures are deleted prior to an analysis run?
%       Anything stored in handles.Measurements or handles.Pipeline
% will be deleted at the beginning of the analysis run, whereas
% anything stored in handles.Settings, handles.Preferences, and
% handles.Current will be retained from one analysis to the next. It
% is important to think about which of these data should be deleted at
% the end of an analysis run because of the way Matlab saves
% variables: For example, a user might process 12 image sets of nuclei
% which results in a set of 12 measurements ("ImageTotalNucArea")
% stored in handles.Measurements. In addition, a processed image of
% nuclei from the last image set is left in the handles structure
% ("SegmNucImg"). Now, if the user uses a different algorithm which
% happens to have the same measurement output name "ImageTotalNucArea"
% to analyze 4 image sets, the 4 measurements will overwrite the first
% 4 measurements of the previous analysis, but the remaining 8
% measurements will still be present. So, the user will end up with 12
% measurements from the 4 sets. Another potential problem is that if,
% in the second analysis run, the user runs only a module which
% depends on the output "SegmNucImg" but does not run a module that
% produces an image by that name, the module will run just fine: it
% will just repeatedly use the processed image of nuclei leftover from
% the last image set, which was left in handles.Pipeline.
