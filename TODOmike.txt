Mike's TODO list

FIGURE OUT WHY NUMBERS ARE WEIRD FOR PHOSPHO HISTONE 3 DATA IN DATABASE - e.g. why isn't pH3 staining within the nucleus???

Note: sample 48 = String, sample 340 = CyclinA

Anne 12/23: I noticed something peculiar in the movie I am analyzing - several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance. Can you check whether this is true for other images, and if it's a bug?

Anne 12/23: Matlab license issues - think ahead whether we will need to license matlab on the whole cluster next year? did you hear from fran?  If it helps for us to cut back the needed licenses, you could put on your TODO long term to get the cluster compiled version figured out.

Anne 1/5: we might need to process Jason's human images to produce the last  figure of the paper. This is just a reminder that this might be a project down the road. It would give you the chance to process images on the cluster.

****** Anne 12/23 - MANUSCRIPT PROJECTS ******
Figure B-a: Dros cell count (or just do Human)
Figure B-b: Human cell count (or just do Dros)
Figure B-c: CPvalid1 cell area figure
Figure B-d: CPvalid1 cell cycle figure
Figure B-d HUMAN: Process images and prepare Jason’s human cell cycle vs flow cytometry figures (waiting for jason to give us a matched set of flow data + images).
Figure B-e: Separate G2 and M phase cells by size, even though they are all 4N. Probably use Jason control cells, or Dros no dsRNA cells from CPvalid1 though I think they don't change size as dramatically.
Figure B-f: pH3 (red) is localized in the nucleus.
Figure B-g: shape and texture for wt cells.
Figure B-h: shape (or maybe texture) outliers.

Figure C: validation across many organisms - some histograms of wt vs. abnormal, and some before/after frames from movie:
- Put before/after frames from movie into illustrator (HeLa, yeast, c elegans).
- mouse cell cycle (Shomit)
- non-Movie Yeast example - SCMD was a bust, waiting for images from Franco or U. Australia. Don’t forget that normalization may be necessary to line the histograms up from one image ot the next.
- plants?
- bacteria?
- CHO cells - do not bother, David thinks it's no big deal.
***********************************

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES
