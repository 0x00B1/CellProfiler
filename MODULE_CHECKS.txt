CalculateStatistics		Mike,        Anne (didn't check code until we are ready to play around with it for real: we really really have to doublecheck the code and be absolutely sure it's perfect before we brag about our Z' and V factors being so good!)

MeasureRatios			Mike,        Anne

MergeBatchOutput		Mike,        Anne (We still need to check and see that it works and that the output files produced are exportable)

Restart			            ,        Anne
				(Need to verify)

Rotate				    ,        Anne
Need to verify - check lots of combinations on an image of a grid of lines or something that is easy to verify that the rotation is really working properly, and that the X,Y (for coordinate) and clockwise/counterclockwise (for ANGLE) is stated correctly.
