- (Anne 4/25/06) - The MergeOutputFiles and ConvertBatchFiles data tools do not seem to go to the default output folder when it asks you to select the first batch CP output file. Check through all the data tools to be sure they go to the right place.

- (Anne 4/25/06) - Fix the ExportDatabase data tool - we have not kept it current with the ExportToDatabase module. First, get it functional, and second, make it work for standard output files and also with batch output files (so you don't have to use the Convert BatchFiles data tool, as is currently stated in the help). Lastly, be sure to update the help so it is accurate. Also, try to address the other comments described in the limitations section of the help for this tool.

- (Requested by Anne 2-23-06) - Make Calculate Ratios Data Tool (in the Developer's drop box) into a real data tool (right now, you run it from the command line with all the variables hardcoded). Share code with the Calc Ratios module as much as possible.

- (Anne 4/25/06) - ViewData fails on batch-created output files (this error is expected), but the error occurs at the command line (see below) - we should catch the error and tell the user to use the data tool MergeOutputFiles or ConvertBatchFiles to put the batch output files in a format which can be analyzed properly with the data tools. In fact, once we fix this for ViewData, we should do the same for all data tools.

- (Requested By Colin 1-13-06) - In the ShowDataOnImage data tool, there is an error when you close out of the window that pops up after clicking on the NumberOfDecimals button.
