CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
November 8, 2005

- (Requested by Anne 11-16-05) - This is potentially very difficult, but thought I'd ask: right now, we can exclude objects touching the edge for identifyprimautomatic. This only works for objects touching the edge of the rectangular image. If we were feeding in an image to ID Prim Auto that had been cropped into a circle, the cropping shape is stored in the handles structure (CropMask or CroppingMask - one is the size of the original image and the other is the size of the cropped image) so can we use this information to discard objects touching the edge of whatever shape is depicted in the CropMask or CroppingMask (can't remember which one is the size of the cropped image)?

- (Requested by Anne 11-16-05) - Fairly frequently if something goes wrong during closing the CP window, it stays open and it seems like there is no way to force it to close. Can you figure this out?  Is there something we can do at the command line - I tried close all but that didn't help.

e.g. I tried to close CP and got this error:
??? Reference to non-existent field 'FontSize'.
Error in ==> CPquestdlg at 106
    FontSize = handles.Preferences.FontSize;
??? Error while evaluating figure CloseRequestFcn.

- (Requested by Anne 11-02-05) - Susan will eventually work on making ExportData (datatool) into a module.  Is it possible in a general way to make all our data tools easily wrapped so they can be run as modules as well? I think perhaps the easiest way to accomplish this would be to write all the data tools as modules, and then when running them as a data tool, pass the module a fake handles structure.
Histogram: DONE (can talk about options)
PlotMeasurements: DONE (can talk about options)
ShowDataOnImage: DONE (can talk about options)
ExportData:

- Make compiled CellProfiler work on cluster

- (Requested by Anne 11-08-05) - Long-term, maybe UROP: Can we make PlotMeasurements as cool as Histograms? e.g. selecting subsets of images, 'gating' by plotting only cells above a threshold in a particular measurement.

- Check through each module (~2 per day):
EVERYONE:
	- Go through the code looking for instances of the term "image set" and
		replace with "cycle" where appropriate.
	- (Requested by Anne) - Test each module on color vs grayscale and make
		sure they all work or have some type of error catching.
	- (Requested by Anne 9-01-05) - We'd like to make the variable descriptions
		consistent - at the very least we should try to be consistent with
		stating "Choose" (rather than "select"), and phrasing things as
		questions versus "Enter the ..."   Also, look through the variable
		descriptions for uses of computer-ific words like 'segmentation'.
	- Write help if DNE
	- Check that fontsize is never hard-coded and instead uses the user's preference.
	- Remove 'saving images' text
MIKE:
	- Make sure all code is using CPfigure rather than figure. I think the
		DataLayout tool in particular is using figure.
	- Smart Indent
	- M Lint error checking
	- (Requested by Anne)- IdentifyPrimAutomatic has a nice thing when you click
		on one of the images within the figure that allows you to open in its
		own window, etc. We should implement this feature into all the modules.
---------------------------------------------------
JUST PRIOR TO PUBLIC RELEASE:
- Prepare updated manual
- Make reference sheet with short descriptions of the modules (see manuscript table).
- For each common application (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and cell type (e.g. human, yeast, drosophila), make an example pipeline file and a nice pdf document showing the results: We should use the 'test mode' option in IdentifyPrimAutomatic to show all the possibilities, and then show results from the ideal pipeline. This will give people a good starting place for their images. Anne has example images and starting points for new pipelines in the ExampleFlyImages folder.
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.
- copy CP code onto CDs for Colin to take to ASCB meeting in San Francisco.
NO... let's just give people the web address, so they get the freshest copy of the code!  And, it's less work for us!
- tell the following sites that review and list software:
www.zdnet.com	downloads.mycomputer.com	www.windows95.sk
directory.google.com	www.libpng.org	cn.tech.yahoo.com
www.dmoz.org	softload.narod.ru	www.chinabyte.com
www.winsite.com	www.cheta.net www.open-bio.org    caBIG
- Get the email addresses of all corresponding authors from all the research articles Anne has collected, and also microscope facility directors and send them an email telling them to visit cellprofiler.org and sign up for the email list if desired.
- The Broad institute has done a lot of thinking and infrastructure for distributing free software. They have narrowed down to 3 licenses (GPL, a variant of academic open source, and one other) that their scientists use and they also have pages to help register users who download their software etc. this might be useful for us.

---------------------------------------------------
POST-PUBLIC RELEASE SUPPORT:
     - Monitor imaging newsgroups and inform people about the software
     - Provide technical support/help desk
     - Fix bugs
     - Maintain for new releases of OS's and Matlab
     - Check Matlab Central for useful code to incorporate into
       CellProfiler or its modules (last checked on 9-16-04:
       Biotech/medical, Graphics (all 3 categories), Image Processing,
       Utilities - GUI Tools & examples, and Misc.) 
     - Organize training workshops
     - Present at conferences, especially microscope facility director-oriented ones.
---------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO DO WHEN NEW VERSIONS OF MATLAB COME OUT:
- update the image file formats that are readable in LoadImages modules. 
- For many functions we have made our own CP versions - check the new matlab code to see if they've changed anything that would warrant us re-creating the CP subfunctions to use the new code.
