Colin's TODO list


(Anne 2-9-06 URGENT) - Please modify the IdentifyPrimManual so that after each clicking/identification step, the user has the choice of clicking/identifying another object within the image or continuing on in the pipeline. This would allow them to identify an unlimited number of objects per image, rather than just one.

(Anne 2-9-06 URGENT) - There is a weird bug in the IdentifyPrimManual in the pipeline I put in the Dev. DropBox (temp1PIPE.mat, which goes with slide3-1.tif) I usually try to outline a cell with ~10 clicks in a circular shape and it fails but does not give much of an error msg.

(Anne 2-9-06) Usually I name (in an IdentifyPrimAutomatic module) the outlines so they can later be overlaid on an image. When I type in the name in IdentifyPrimAutomatic and then go to the OverlayOutlines module, the new outlines name is not selectable. If I go back and click on the outlines name again and press enter and then go back to OverlayOutlines, it finally shows up. So it seems like some sort of little bug.

-There are some problems with the Help Menus.

- Colin, I made a ton of changes to identify modules so they all produce outlines consistently. Could you please check that they all still work with overlay outlines?

- (Requested by Anne 9-21-05) - We haven't tested these modules in a *very* long time - so we should try them out & make sure they work!
