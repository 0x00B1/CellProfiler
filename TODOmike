\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mike's TODO list\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - On the windows machines that Stephanie & Monica & Winston use over at CSAIL, the windows appear off the top of the screen for some reason. It was only a problem for the Identify modules and RGB Split module but not Crop and Measure modules.  I've no idea whether it's related to the CPFixAspectRatio function (based on the 4 modules I checked there is a correlation, but it's not definitive). We should figure out what the point of CPFixAspectRatio is and document its code with some help to describe it.  We may also need to incorporate it throughout the code - some modules use it and others don't, so we ought to make things consistent.  Also (a separate issue, i think), error/help box text didn't fit in their windows and so was not visible. \
\
- (Requested by Anne 8-23-05) - Go through the code looking for instances of the term "image set" and replace with "cycle" where appropriate.\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - There is a general popupmenu bug: for example, in ImageTiler, if I load this module after loading other modules (like SaveImages) and leave the default "TiledImage" as it is, this 'TiledImage' option does not automatically show up in the SaveImages module as an image I can choose. The workaround is simply to click on the TiledImage text in the  ImageTiler module. This refreshes the popup menu in the saveimages module so that the TiledImage can now be selected. Another popupmenu bug: To reproduce, first add for example IdentifyPrimIntensIntens to the pipeline, close the add module window, and then add for example the LoadImagesText module. Move the LoadImagesText module to the top. Now it is still not possible to choose an input image in the IdentifyPrimIntensIntens module. This problem might have the same root case.\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - Variable bug: To reproduce, make a pipeline of LoadImagesText, then IdentifyPrimIntensIntens, then MeasureAreaShape. In MeasureAreaShape, choose Cells in the first slot. Then go to Identify module and change the objects to be identified from Cells to Nuclei. When returning to MeasureAreaShape, you will see that what was previously set to Cells has automatically changed to Nuclei. In my view, this is unanticipated behavior and should not happen. It ought to stay set to Cells until you change it (even though Cells will not exist and the pipeline will fail, at least it is the user's fault and they can figure out the problem).  The worse problem (other than it being unanticipated) is that when you actually run the pipeline, the MeasureAreaShape module still goes looking for Cells rather than Nuclei, so it fails. This part of the error can be prevented by going to MeasureAreaShape and re-selected Nuclei, even though that is the option that's already chosen. So, re-selecting it seems to embed the proper choice into the handles.\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - variable bug: for IdentifyPrimIntenIntens (and possibly other modules), there is a problem with the variable - what do you want to call the labeled matrix image?  Typing in a custom entry using the 'Other...' option yields an error. See that module for more details on the error produced.  Perhaps we decided that this bug is not worth fixing, in which case remove the comments there and convert any other similar situations in other modules so that this error does not occur.  Note: We have replaced IdentifyPrimIntenIntens with IdentifyEasy recently. We still want to fix the problem because a similar thing occurs in IdentifyEasy but you will still want to take a look at the code in IdentifyPrimIntenIntens because the bug is described in detail in there (see Outdated folder).\
\
- When loading a module whose variable revision number has changed, many of the variables come up as blank in the window where you choose between Saved and Default.\
\
NOTE FOR THE ABOVE BUGS: There is a line marked FIXME in CellProfiler.m that might explain some of these issues.\
\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - Maybe make new pipelines to show off different features of CellProfiler if desired (e.g. the SpotIdentifier or yeast colony finding).\

\
- (Requested by Anne) - In several places there is text information entered as a variable description that does not need a corresponding variable box (see SaveImages for an example). A box with the text 'n/a' appears next to these variable descriptions that is unnecessary.  This seems odd - can we make it so the variable box doesn't appear if it is n/a?  I think maybe the reason it is done this way is to be sure that if you scroll down using the slider this extra text information is displayed properly.\
