On the Mac at least, close windows button often causes X windows to freeze up and become unresponsive so that it becomes impossible to properly quit CellProfiler and therefore Matlab. Check the code and see whether the way we are performing this function makes sense or if you can see why it would be causing problems.

Look into font sizes.  What In Han has tried so far is changing the font/handle object units to characters; as recommended on the Mathworks website.  However, this still made the figures look different on different platforms.

Decide whether to incorporate bug fixes from Matt Tudor into AlgIdentifyPrimAdaptThresholdC (see %MT lines in AlgTempMattTudor.m) 

    Make a module to identify and count and measure objects within
    previously identified objects (e.g. nucleoli or organelles or
    speckles within nuclei or cells).  Not sure how to save the
    individual measurements for each sub-object.

    Make a shape-based IdentifyPrim module which recognizes
    oblong/elliptical objects rather than perfectly round
    objects. Actually, adopt the current IdentifyPrimShapeIntens to
    take in an ellipticity factor which can be set to 1 for perfect
    circles or some other number for oblong objects.  There is a paper
    somewhere detailing an ellipse-based shape transform (maybe Ray
    has it?).

Also, check through all the IdentifyPrim modules (and maybe IdentifySec too), to determine whether they are streamlines. Right now, for example, there are two compute-intensive watershed steps in IdentifyPrimIntensIntens and I am not entirely certain they are both necessary.

   Evaluate and possible incorporate feature measurements from Bob
   Murphy's lab into our Measure modules (Murphy, Velliste, Porreca
   2003 etc).

    Add more texture measurements to the MeasureIntensityTexture
    module. Perhaps use texture measurements from Murphy, Velliste,
    and Porreca 2003.  The image processing toolbox 5.0.1 has new
    texture analysis tools, though they would need to be adapted to
    deal with individual objects rather than entire images:
       entropy -- Calculates the entropy of an intensity image
       entropyfilt -- Calculates the local entropy of an intensity image
       graycomatrix -- Computes the gray-level co-occurrence matrix from an image
       graycoprops -- Extracts properties from a gray-level co-occurrence matrix
       rangefilt -- Calculates the local range of an image
       stdfilt -- Calculates the standard deviation of an image
