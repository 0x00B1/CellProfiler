   Change CellProfiler.m code to preallocate if possible, relating to the following variables (line numbers are approximate).
L 1391 (C 29-40): Array 'Measurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1485 (C 9-28): Array 'EditedMeasFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1514 (C 9-31): Array 'EditedHeadingFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1982 (C 13-28): Array 'PlotBinLocations' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1991 (C 45-55): Array 'XTickLabels' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2073 (C 17-34): Array 'ListOfMeasurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2532 (C 13-32): Array 'EditedMeasFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2578 (C 25-49): Array 'EditedPotentialImageNames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2886 (C 25-31): Array 'Pending' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 3112 (C 25-31): Array 'Lengths' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed 

   Fix the "FIXME" sections in CellProfiler, unless Ray wanted to do it himself
   
   "Make projection" module (= average, get code from DivideAllMean). Did In Han finish this already?  If so, make a manual page.

   Rescale intensity image (stretch histogram)

   Make closefigures and openfigures not global if possible.
