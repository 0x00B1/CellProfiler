Mike's TODO list

If you need to get an example output file (might be a pain b/c too big to email?) you can email Winston at timp@wi.mit.edu

- Add ray's new adjustment to SecProp function for secondary distance

- (Requested by Anne) - Add background masking to the identify sec distance module
       (make it optional in case a cell stain image is not
       available).
