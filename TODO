CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
November 8, 2004

Infrastructure improvements:
- Allow running on a cluster in interactive mode
- Allow running on a cluster in batch mode
- Change saving of the output file to be faster for large jobs
- Allow batches of different settings to be run and their results compared
- Allow automatic selection of settings based on hand-traced images
- 'Start job midway' module, run image set #XXXX (allow putting in a bunch of comma-delimited numbers to allow random), every 50th.
- There is no way to save images which are normally calculated for display only when running on the cluster, because the figure windows are not open so the calculations are skipped.
- Timer: Have the time for first set separate from the time for subsequent sets.
- Have the save settings function automatically add SET to the name > can't currently do it with uisave.
- When there are large numbers of images in a folder, the response of uigetfile is really slow.  Can fix?
- Prevent clicking pause/cancel buttons twice.
- To aid in interactive selection of settings, allow user to create a figure window where images can be dragged and overlaid and toggled back and forth. See Inca and dragndrop in Matlab Central.
- Have image windows pay attention to aspect ratio of images.

Image analysis modules - New:
- Make modules to identify objects in transmitted light/DIC images.
- Neurite outgrowth module
- Particle tracking over time module
- Make a user-scoring module that allows the user to view and annotate each image manually. Show control side by side (1-4 at a time) and add that assessment to the data structure. Maybe allow randomizing (to do blind tests). Allow clicking through.
- Make a quality-control module that checks for evenness of illumination, linearity of exposure time, lamp flickering, and slide-scale variation.
- Make a module to expand or shrink secondary objects. (e.g. to define membrane compartment)
- Binucleate cells: figure out how to identify and count them
- Align/resize stack of images (like yeast plates). See Matlab demo on image registration. Did Chris already do this?

Image analysis modules - Improvements:
- Make separate Identify Secondary modules: one for bright lines and one for dark lines between objects.  Also try watershedding the gradient image rather than the original.
- Improve background/cell edge finding - threshold vs. adaptive threshold vs. watershed
- Add background subtraction to the identify sec distance module (make it optional in case a cell stain image is not available).
- Make another primary object identification module based on Intensity then distance.
- Improve cell segmentation (though already it's quite good)
- Annotate which modules work for grayscale vs color.
- Spot Identifier: Figure out Excel mac vs Pc problems (Anne has an email from Mathworks describing the issue, thread QW38).  Allow asking if numbers are in rows or columns.  Check offsets, flipping. Display value only when clicking (see email that Anne has: Mathworks tricks for interactive figures). Make manual page. Toggle several images.
- Image Tiler: Main GUI's error catching is causing problems when sample info is loaded.  Allow zoom in on thumbnail: get filename (GET COORDINATES) and display high res image.  Needs error catching for images to be the same size.  Display window stays open. See tooltips code. Make manual page.  Fails if there are fewer images than the total grid.
- Combine CorrIllumDivideAll with RetrieveImg version.

Data exporting
- Allow data to be exported to bioinformatics programs like Spotfire or GenePattern.
- Allow data to be exported in MAGE format to go into databases.
- Allow data to be exported to Open Microscopy Environment databases.
- Allow adding sample info post-processing

Data visualization/analysis:
[[[ Note: We are not sure whether we want to focus on data visualization or leave this to other programs like Spotfire or GenePattern or Open Microscopy Environment.]]]
- Would like to be able to nicely graph data (Matlab is a bit limiting at this point in time) and click on data points to retrieve the high resolution image.
- Would like to be able to sort images and data points to generate hit lists meeting certain criteria. - showregions at Matlab Central might be useful for interactivity
- Would like to be able to transform data; e.g. normalize for slide-scale variation, calculate the percent of cells in each image meeting certain criteria.
- Allow sample info (e.g. gene names, image-specific identifiers) to be added to an output file after it has been created.
- Display data on image button: it currently is using global variables to store the numerical data, rather than using UserData.  Thus, the figure cannot be saved with the numerical data still accessible.  See histograms for how to use UserData to store the numbers with the figure.
- Histograms: allow fewer labels, plus fewer decimals (right now, it's either-or).
- Plot data button: allow adding error bars reflecting stdev or sem to the single parameter, multiple images bar plot (matlab central has error bar code).
- Plot data button: allow displaying two parameters vs. each other in a scatter plot.
- Compressed histograms: Add Y sample labels, allow to show relative brightness, allow to put in order by mean, change # of sig figs.  See hist2 at MC to smooth histograms.  Eventually allow histograms to be interactively updated? See automatic updated plot at MC, and also fancyplot. 
- Fix interactive zoom button (within Show Image button):
(1) It seems to always work OK the first time you click on Interactive Zoom.  The subsequent times you click on it though: sometimes it works just fine and other times there is no change to the image itself - it stays at fully zoomed out and doesn't respond to mouse clicks.  Perhaps related, sometimes lots of errors are spit out at the command line (I think only on subsequent tries to use the functionality).  Actually, maybe it has something to do with having other figure windows open at the same time?
(2) Once things are working, I would like to add this Interactive Zoom button to several other places: In CellProfiler.m: "Display data on image", "Show pixel data", and all of the figure display windows (for each algorithm - I am not sure whether buttons will stay intact, though, once each algorithm runs. so I am not sure whether it makes more sense to have the button added within each algorithm's code or within the main CellProfiler code when the window is first created). The most important thing is to add the button to "AlgImageTiler.m"; that is why I acquired this code in the first place.- Calculations for display purposes only: surround by an if that is: "If figure window is open OR saveimage = Yes, then do these calculations."

Increasing platform usability:
- Compile CellProfiler to run independently of Matlab
- Allow importing of images from Open Microscopy Environment databases.
- ImageJ plugins: allow them to be run through CellProfiler

Debugging:

Validation:
- Write algorithms to compare hand-traced results to CellProfiler results quantitatively, then apply them to our hand-traced data sets.
- Hand-outline a second set of images to compare to Chris' set.

User-friendliness/interface/help:
- Make "applications" technical notes and automatic settings files to give a good starting place for common applications (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and for common cell types.
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.
- Make the help/manual prettier: For each example image that is just text, move it into the help for that file, because as it is these images are stretched a lot; Remove TM from CellProfiler's name in the help/manual; Rename HelpHistogram and HelpNormalization now that the buttons have different names; Can the manual compiler use the powerpoint file directly, or must it be saved as PNG or JPG first, for the cover pages?; Make the Help1-4 and the HelpButtons pages look nicer by giving each section a nicer heading.
- Make Images and Data buttons into icons in a toolbar in CellProfiler's main GUI.
- 'Fetch new modules from website' button in CellProfiler's main GUI.
- 'Report bug' button in CellProfiler's main GUI.
- Make all pop-up windows use the proper background color and come to the center of the CP window (helpdlg, warndlg, msgbox): requires getting the handle then setting the color and position.
- Make a "send email" module that makes Matlab send an email to you after a user-specified number of algorithms have been processed (e.g. after the first, or last, or every 1000 image sets) (see sendmail: built in matlab function?)  Need to enter an email address and have a flexible way to take in when you want the email sent.  (e.g. BOX1: After first?, BOX2: After last?, BOX3: every X number of sets, BOXES4-9: after image # X, BOX11: email address.)

Post-release support:
- Monitor imaging newsgroups and inform people about the software
- Provide technical support/help desk
- Fix bugs
- Maintain for new releases of OS's and Matlab
- Organize training workshops
- Present at conferences
- Check Matlab Central for useful code to incorporate into CellProfilerTM or its modules (last checked on 9-16-04: Biotech/medical, Graphics (all 3 categories), Image Processing, Utilities - GUI Tools & examples, and Misc.)
