Setting up new computers to access WIBR servers using NFS
Anne Carpenter   July 22, 2005

[[[Note: connecting via cifs://gobo is flexible because it allows you to log in from any WIBR computer using your CCDOM account, but the connection is very slow.  Connecting via nfs must be set up as follows for each computer itself, but once the connection is made it is very fast and doesn't require login]]].

On Mac OSX, go to Applications > Utilities > NetInfo Manager

Security > Authenticate

Go to /  groups  	(highlight it)
And select one of the groups

Then click Duplicate (be sure you don't have one of its properties highlighted or you will duplicate one line within the group)

In the lower panel, change the fields as follows (doubleclick to edit each field):
users		root, cellprofileruser
realname 	Imaging group  [or any nice name you want to give it, doesn't matter]
name		imaging
passwd	*
gid		1110

Domain > Save changes


----------
Here are the groups:
imaging 1110
sabata 2148
sabdbw 2145
sabcarp 2153
sabatini 128
cellomics 2149
-----------
Create a folder on your computer's hard drive ( at root / ) at the topmost level called 'nfs', with one subfolder for each server. You can do this at the command line in Terminal like this:
cd /
mkdir nfs
cd nfs
mkdir sabatini_dbw02
mkdir sabatini_dbw01
mkdir imaging
mkdir sabatini1_ata
mkdir sabatini2_ata
mkdir carpente_ata

At the command line in a Terminal window, be sure that you are logged in as someone who has permission to access those servers (e.g. cellprofileruser).  Then type each of these lines, with Enter after each one:
mount tap6:/sabatini_dbw02   /nfs/sabatini_dbw02
mount tap5:/sabatini_dbw01   /nfs/sabatini_dbw01
mount tap2:/imaging          /nfs/imaging      
mount tap6:/sabatini1_ata    /nfs/sabatini1_ata 
mount tap6:/sabatini2_ata    /nfs/sabatini2_ata 
mount tap6:/carpente_ata     /nfs/carpente_ata

The connections are now made but are likely not visible at /nfs/FOLDERNAME, so you can either wait for a while or you can force the finder window to refresh by creating a file in the /nfs folder and then deleting it (this is a bug in Mac OS X that doesn't refresh frequently and also doesn't let you force windows to refresh).  Once everything refreshes, the icons for the servers will appear on the desktop but also at /nfs/FOLDERNAME.

So now everything is set up, and you should never need to repeat any of these steps.

Setting up new users:
Use System Preferences on the computer to add a new user. It's best to use the same shortname as you pan to use for your other unix accounts.
Probably it will be useful to email unix@wi.mit.edu and ask them to add your username to the above groups in order for you to modify any files on the servers. This will also allow you to access the servers using the cifs://gobo protocol & your CCDOM login & password from any computer.
