Mike's TODO list

(Anne 2-22) Robert reports that Zeiss will *probably* fix the macro, possibly even by thursday or friday, but in the meantime, please run a pipeline where we rotate the SYBR green image so the top two spots are horizontal and then make a position list from the identified spots. That way, Robert can test the position list imaging on Thursday after lab meeting and also we will have a chance to see how the new computer handles this big job.

(Anne 2-22) Run Arne's latest images.

(Anne 2-16) Put figure 5's SBS PIPE and examples on the website as the more typical CNT assay. Also, put all those unzipped example folders into our SVN repository.

(Anne 2-9-06) Please reprocess Fly200, all slides, and deposit data into the database under a new name.
(Anne 2-9-06) Please reprocess NIRHT and deposit data into the database under a new name.

****** Anne 1/7 - MANUSCRIPT FIGURES ******

Post all the example images and pipelines at cellprofiler.org

When the manuscript is submitted, *please* move *everything* you've ever processed on the G5's and your PC to its own, dated experiment folder on sabatini3_ata, within a Figure folder if appropriate.

****** END OF MANUSCRIPT PROJECTS ******

Mike 1-31-06: Compile CP for cluster purposes.

FIGURE OUT WHY NUMBERS ARE WEIRD FOR PHOSPHO HISTONE 3 DATA IN DATABASE - e.g. why isn't pH3 staining within the nucleus???

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES

- Create business cards for yourself! I've put files in Promotional > Business Cards, plus instructions for doing it. For mine, I'd like to keep the format of having WIBR-stuff on the front and CP stuff on the back. You are welcome to create CP-only cards (this is probably better because officially the WIBR doesn't like us to use their logo without getting it approved through the administration which is a pain).  I've got a word file that contains many links to the same business card file - that way you can adjust the business card file for different people or to update contact info, and then just change the link in the word file and it should all update. I bought stiff paper which apparently feeds through laser printers ok - it's on my desk. We have a laser printer in Lahra/David Sabatini's office called SABATINI COLOR you can use, but we should try to minimize how much color ink we use, so making the cards have a white background would be a good idea, and would look nice for the CP logo (for mine, with the WIBR stuff, i think we have to keep it purple background, but for practicing, I'd stick to a white background card). I'm sure we ca n find a paper cutter somewhere (the office above Lahra's on the floor above us).  The spacing of the cards on those template files may be messed up because it's designed for perforated business card paper, but that paper is kind of lame because it leaves little fuzzies on the edges of the cards so i think we are better off using plain card stock and a paper cutter.  Update the instructions if anything changes. I guess we could SVN commit a new card for each person?  or just store a card for each person on your local computer but leave the template untouched. whatever.
