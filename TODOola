Getting the SQL conversion working. We are really starting to process large data sets routinely so
we are likely to need this sometime in the next week.

Modify segmentation algorithms so that they store number of objects and location.

Check that importing gene names still works and that their output is exportable. This is something
I have not used in a while, so there may be latent bugs already.  It is not something we are using
routinely right now, because mostly we are doing huge jobs where Ray manually imports gene names
and id's into the database, but it should be nearly functional and it's worth keeping its format up
with the rest of CP.

And after *that*, polishing up IdentifyEasy so that it is consistent with the other IdentifyPrim
modules (e.g. compatible with downstream modules)

And after *that*, probably getting through many of the simple user-interface things on the main
TODO list.
