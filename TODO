CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
REARRANGED JANUARY 27th, 2005  IN ORDER OF PRIORITY

(+ sign indicates more challenging projects)
---------------------------------------------------

WANT IT NOW:

- For the image and data tools help, doubleclicking in the listbox should call the okbuttoncallback function.

- DONE, BUT DELIMITER IS NOT FUNCTIONING WELL ON ANNE"S COMPUTER. OTHERWISE IT IS ALMOST READY.- Allow the user to 'export' the current settings into some nice, person-readable text file so they have a permanent record. 

- Load movies module, with ability to load each frame of a .mov or .avi file.  (Look at AvitoImageSlices.m)
  
- Make measure windows expand to fit the number of lines of data that are produced. 

- Help function does not work for ImageTools and DataTools; The menu often doesn't return to the default first position ('DataTools' or 'ImageTools') after running a tool.

- Improve the Data tool "PlotOrExportHistograms":
*Make the dialog box that asks for input from the user (~6 questions) wider.
*When filenames have underscores and these filenames are used to label each histogram in the display, the underscores cause the following text to be subscripted. We fixed this somewhere else in the code at one point by doing a string replacement of underscores with some symbol that prevents the underscore from being read as a string modifier. 
*Flip rows vs columns for exporting the raw histogram data, so that columns are histogram bins and rows are images.
*Not sure if I used the global function properly. The goal is to load the Answers the user chose the previous time through the tool.  
* Update help for this tool and for PlotSingleMeasurement (they used to be the same tool).

- For the Export Mean Data DataTool, ask the user whether whether they want images or measurements as rows vs. columns (see ExportCellByCell for an example).

+++ When there are large numbers of images in a folder, the
       response of uigetfile is really slow.  Can fix? 

+++ Make a shape-based IdentifyPrim module which recognizes
       oblong/elliptical objects rather than perfectly round
       objects. Actually, adopt the current IdentifyPrimShapeIntens to
       take in an ellipticity factor which can be set to 1 for perfect
       circles or some other number for oblong objects.  There is a
       paper somewhere detailing an ellipse-based shape transform
       (maybe Ray has it?). 

---------------------------------------------------

WANT IT SOON (~ for next beta release, late February 2005):

- When viewing algorithms in the main GUI on the Mac platform, the down arrow should
       move from one highlighted algorithm to the next (right now, the
       dotted line highlighting moves but nothing happens).

- Adjust ModuleNames or VariableValues so that their dimensions match (if possible). E.g. the following example has 6 modules loaded, so it would make more sense if VariableValues was a 13 x 6 cell rather than 6 x 13, so that all four Settings have 6 columns.
Settings =      ModuleNames: {1x6 cell}
             VariableValues: {6x13 cell}
         NumbersOfVariables: [13 6 5 6 4 8]
    VariableRevisionNumbers: [2 0 1 0 1 1]

- Remove all 'cd' commands from modules and use full pathnames instead.  In particular, modules that need to look at all the images in a set (Load images, identifythreshold, correctillum, subtract background) typically change to the directory then read the images, whereas we could construct the image filename using fullfile(pathname,filename). (The reason for doing this is to prevent CellProfiler from unexpectedly changing the current directory in matlab.  However, if this method takes more processing time, perhaps we should not make this change).

- it is a bit annoying to have to type in the name of an output file each time you are testing parameters. Have the output file be automatically named (e.g. incrementing numbers (TempCPOUT1.mat, TempCPOUT2.mat) that are not already existing in the output directory) when you press Analyze Images but have not typed a name into the box.

- Display data on image button: it currently is using global
       variables to store the numerical data, rather than using
       UserData.  Thus, the figure cannot be saved with the numerical
       data still accessible.  See histograms for how to use UserData
       to store the numbers with the figure. 

- Make a module to expand or shrink secondary objects. (e.g. to define a membrane compartment). Test to be sure that downstream modules work on the newly defined region: measure, subtract from the original compartment, save images.

+++ Make a module to identify and count and measure objects
       within previously identified objects (e.g. nucleoli or
       organelles or speckles within nuclei or cells).  This also requires designing a way to store measurements of Subobjects. See MeasureNeighbors.m for an example of saving several measurements per object.  Need to also develop tools to export the Subobject measurements.

++ Histograms: allow fewer labels, plus fewer decimals (right now, it's either-or). 

- Add background subtraction to the identify sec distance module
       (make it optional in case a cell stain image is not
       available). 

- Be sure that all exporting tools will function properly if some
       measurement fields are left blank, which is the case when there
       are no objects in a particular image, for example.  I am pretty
       sure that export mean data and export cell by cell data will
       result in an error. 

- For the ExportDataButton in CellProfiler.m, warn the user if
       'Image' and 'Imported' fields have different numbers of
       measurements - I am not sure how the exporting would work in
       this case.

- If there are no modules loaded in the main CellProfiler window, the Save Settings button should realize this and refuse to save a settings file: warndlg('There are no modules currently loaded, so the pipeline will not be saved.').

- The error checking for "there are no images in this folder"
       should be moved out of CellProfiler.m and into the two Load
       Images modules, since some pipelines may not require images in
       order to run properly. (Note: I am not sure if someone did this already).

- For LoadImagesText module, make the error catching more descriptive.
       If there are no image files matching the specified text, right
       now it just says "there are no image files in the directory." when
       it ought to say "there are no image files in the directory that
       contain the text XXX."

- In MeasureCorrelation module, have the display window indicate whether the region analyzed is 'overall', or the name of the object within which correlation is measured. (that is, the contents of the last variable box).

- Add Image set # to the display for AlgAlign.m (see other displays for the precise format).

- The confirmation window upon "cancel after image set" button clicking ought to say "confirm cancel", not "confirm close". 

- Add this to the Show Image help: The Show Image button shows
       pixel values in the range 0 to 1.  Images are loaded into
       CellProfiler in this range so that modules behave consistently.
       The display is set to the same range so that, for example, if a
       user wants to look at an image in order to determine which
       threshold to use within a module, the pixel values are directly
       applicable. 

- The Histograms tab at the lower part of the image is called Plot data, but seems to work as described in the manual. Change the manual to match.

- The Normalization tab at the bottom of the window is called Data Layout and works differently from the Normalization described in the manual at page 17. Change the manual to match.

- Make the help/manual prettier: For each example image that is just text, move it into the help for that file, because as it is these images are stretched a lot. 

[Do the following prior to releasing the new beta version:
- Smart Indent
- M Lint error checking
- Check for TODO's
- Test every module & button
- Especially, try canceling and closing & opening figure windows
- Prepare updated manual]

---------------------------------------------------

WANT IT BEFORE PUBLIC RELEASE (~ May 2005):

+++ Download code relating to Perlman, Mitchison, et al. Science
       2004 and make modules accordingly (Laplacian of Gaussian to
       identify nuclei) 

- When attempting to Export data using any of the various
       buttons, add an error check in case the mat file does not
       contain the field "Measurements". 

- In the SetPreferences button, fix the code for when the user does not have write access to the matlab root directory. There is a nice routine almost functional there, but it doesn't quite seem to do the right thing: try to write in matlab root first, and if that fails, write in the handles.Current.StartupDirectory) > Also, maybe we should change it so that the current directory it tries to write to is the handles.Current.default output directory, since presumably the user can write there.  That is where CellProfiler should look when trying to load the preferences upon launching, too, if we add this feature.

- In the SetPreferences button in CellProfiler.m, do some error checking to see whether items entered in edit boxes are valid.  For directories, check whether the directory exists and warn the user if it does not (although, still let the nonexistent directory be saved, because perhaps they are not connected to the network or something). For the default output directory, check whether the user has write permission to that directory and warn if not.  For the pixel size and font size, check whether the entry is a number (though I think it needs to be stored as a string within a cell) and revert to the previously saved value if it is not a number.

- Whenever anything is saved to the hard drive, add an error
       check to see whether the user has permission to write to that
       location (esp. CellProfiler.m and AlgSaveImages.m). From within the target directory, run:
       [ignore,Attributes] = fileattrib, if Attributes.UserWrite == 0,
       then error(INSERT PROPER ERROR STUFF HERE), end 

- Add error checking to data-related buttons to determine whether
       the .mat file the user selected is a valid CellProfiler output
       file.

- For the ExportCellByCell button in CellProfiler.m, add an error
       check when exporting "All measurements" to notify the user when
       that image had no objects.  If there are no objects, the export
       should be canceled.

- In CellProfiler.m, look for lines marked: %%% TODO: Fix filename construction, and use a less platform-dependent way to construct the path/filenames (e.g. with Matlab's fullfile function), rather than using slashes.

- In CellProfiler.m, at the lines pertaining to OutputFileOverwrite, use fullfile to make the code multi-platform compatible.

- For the ExportDataButton in CellProfiler.m, see the line marked
       TODO, where the three separate Fieldnames variables should be
       combined into one prior to running the for loops that follow,
       for the sake of simplicity and speed.

- Use the User's preference for font size for all figure displays and dialog boxes.  Do this by adding this line:
    FontSize = handles.Current.FontSize;
After the line in the DISPLAY RESULTS section:
if any(findobj == ThisModuleFigureNumber) == 1
And then, for each subplot or text window, add this line:
    set(gca,'FontSize',FontSize)
For each title, add properties at the end:
    title('Original Image', 'FontSize', FontSize)

-almost- Modify CellProfiler.m to keep track of time elapsed, broken down for each module, and have a display pop open at the end of a pipeline showing how long the first image set took and how long subsequent sets are taking.

- Allow canceling from the first dialog box when using the Save Image As button.

++ Prevent clicking pause/cancel buttons twice in the timer window.

- Have image windows pay attention to aspect ratio of images.

- Save Image As tool: does not work well for all kinds of
       displayed images (e.g. The mean image produced by correct illum
       divide all mean comes out weird). Test it with a bunch of image outputs and make it more compatible.

- Make all pop-up windows use the proper background color and
       come to the center of the CP window (helpdlg, warndlg, msgbox):
       requires getting the handle then setting the color and
       position. Also, for the variablerevisionnumber window, set colors appropriately.

- Export mean data button: currently, if you enter a filename
         in use, it warns you and then cancels the export. Instead,
         the user should be warned and given two options: overwrite,
         or enter a different name.  For an example of this, see the
         use of "while" in the PreviewAndSaveColumnOfSampleInfo
         subfunction in CellProfiler.m

- Change saving of the output file to be faster for large jobs -> tell the user they can change CP.m code to save only if handles.Current.SetBeingAnalyzed is a multiple of 5 or 10 or whatever, rather than saving after every image set.

- Plot data button: allow adding error bars reflecting stdev or
       sem to the single parameter, multiple images bar plot (matlab
       central has error bar code). 

- Plot data button: allow displaying two parameters vs. each
       other in a scatter plot. 

- Combine CorrIllumDivideAll with RetrieveImg version.

- Compressed histograms: Add Y sample labels, allow to show
       relative brightness, allow to put in order by mean, change # of
       sig figs.  See hist2 at MC to smooth histograms.  Eventually
       allow histograms to be interactively updated? See automatic
       updated plot at MC, and also fancyplot.  

- Spot Identifier: Figure out Excel mac vs Pc problems (Anne has
       an email from Mathworks describing the issue, thread QW38).
       Allow asking if numbers are in rows or columns.  Check offsets,
       flipping. Display value only when clicking (see email that Anne
       has: Mathworks tricks for interactive figures). Make manual
       page. Toggle several images. 

- Image Tiler: Main GUI's error catching is causing problems when
       sample info is loaded.  Allow zoom in on thumbnail: get
       filename (GET COORDINATES) and display high res image.  Needs
       error catching for images to be the same size.  Display window
       stays open. See tooltips code. Make manual page.  Fails if
       there are fewer images than the total grid. 

- For the ExportMeanData datatool, display a window with every value that is going to be exported, each one next to a checkbox.  As default, have all checkboxes checked and allow the user to deselect measurements they do *not* want to export.  Might be nice to have a couple of buttons: 'select all' 'deselect all'.

- Make a quality-control button that checks results from an output file for evenness of illumination, linearity of exposure time, lamp flickering, and slide-scale variation. (Based on whatever Ray decides is useful).

- Make another primary object identification module based on
       Intensity then distance. 

- There is no way to save images which are normally calculated
       for display only when running on the cluster, because the
       figure windows are not open so the calculations are skipped. 

- Fix interactive zoom button (within Show Image button):
         (1) It seems to always work OK the first time you click on
     Interactive Zoom.  The subsequent times you click on it though:
     sometimes it works just fine and other times there is no change
     to the image itself - it stays at fully zoomed out and doesn't
     respond to mouse clicks.  Perhaps related, sometimes lots of
     errors are spit out at the command line (I think only on
     subsequent tries to use the functionality).  Actually, maybe it
     has something to do with having other figure windows open at the
     same time? 
         (2) Once things are working, I would like to add this
     Interactive Zoom button to several other places: In
     CellProfiler.m: "Display data on image", "Show pixel data", and
     all of the figure display windows (for each algorithm - I am not
     sure whether buttons will stay intact, though, once each
     algorithm runs. so I am not sure whether it makes more sense to
     have the button added within each algorithm's code or within the
     main CellProfiler code when the window is first created). The
     most important thing is to add the button to "AlgImageTiler.m";
     that is why I acquired this code in the first place.-
     Calculations for display purposes only: surround by an if that
     is: "If figure window is open OR saveimage = Yes, then do these
     calculations." 

- Test and annotate in each module's help which modules work for grayscale vs color images.

- 'Fetch new modules from website' button in CellProfiler's main GUI. 

- 'Report bug' button in CellProfiler's main GUI.

- Have the save settings function automatically add SET to the
       name > can't currently do it with uisave. 

- Would like to be able to sort images and data points to
       generate hit lists meeting certain criteria. - showregions at
       Matlab Central might be useful for interactivity 

- Would like to be able to transform data; e.g. normalize for
       slide-scale variation, calculate the percent of cells in each
       image meeting certain criteria. 

- Make an image sorter to take an incoming image and break the
       loop if the image does not meet particular conditions
       (e.g. maximum pixel intensity is below a certain
       brightness).  This might also mark the images somehow in the
       Measurements.

- Make a module using code from ImageJ
       http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/ called Segmentation using
       k-means clustering. 

[Do the following prior to releasing the public version:
- Make reference sheet with short descriptions of the modules.
- Make "applications" technical notes and automatic settings
       files to give a good starting place for common applications
       (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell
       cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and for common cell
       types. 
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.]

---------------------------------------------------

POST-PUBLIC RELEASE SUPPORT:

     - Monitor imaging newsgroups and inform people about the software
     - Provide technical support/help desk
     - Fix bugs
     - Maintain for new releases of OS's and Matlab
     - Check Matlab Central for useful code to incorporate into
       CellProfiler or its modules (last checked on 9-16-04:
       Biotech/medical, Graphics (all 3 categories), Image Processing,
       Utilities - GUI Tools & examples, and Misc.) 
     - Organize training workshops
     - Present at conferences

---------------------------------------------------

WANT IT SOMEDAY:

- All modules: look for speed improvements (esp. imresize?)

+++ To aid in interactive selection of settings, allow user to
       create a figure window where images can be dragged and overlaid
       and toggled back and forth. See Inca and dragndrop in Matlab
       Central.

+++ Allow data to be exported to bioinformatics programs like GGOBI,
       Spotfire, or GenePattern. (Still trying to decide the best format).

+++ Allow data to be exported in MAGE format to go into databases.

+++ Allow data to be exported to Open Microscopy Environment
       databases.  (Being worked on by Tony Scelfo in Peter Sorger's lab).

+++ Port to python so we don't need to use Matlab anymore

+++ Try to get code for yeast segmentation from this paper, and
       incorporate it into CellProfiler: SCMD: Saccharomyces
       cerevisiae Morphological Database. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jan
       1;32 Database issue:D319-22. PMID: 14681423  

+++ Would like to be able to nicely graph data (Matlab is a bit
       limiting at this point in time) and click on data points to
       retrieve the high resolution image. 

+++ Make a user-scoring module that allows the user to view and
       annotate each image manually. Show control side by side (1-4 at
       a time) and add that assessment to the data structure. Maybe
       allow randomizing (to do blind tests). Allow clicking
       through. Could also be used just for viewing images (e.g. every
       third image in a gigantic image set).  Whether the file name
       and/or sample info is shown should be optional. 

- 'Start job midway' module, run image set #XXXX (allow putting
       in a bunch of comma-delimited numbers to allow random), every
       50th. 

+++ Binucleate cells: figure out how to identify and count them

+++ Make modules to identify objects in transmitted light/DIC images.

+++ Align/resize stack of images (like yeast plates). See Matlab
       demo on image registration. Did Chris already do this? 

+++ Neurite outgrowth module

+++ Particle tracking over time module

---------------------------------------------------

DONE DURING IAP>>>>>>>

     -Done- Make the help button next to the image/data tools work.  It should pop open a listbox asking you to choose which tool's help you would like to see, and then it should extract the help from the tool's m-file.  The listbox should also give general help, i.e. "You can add your own tools by writing Matlab m-files, placing them in the ImageTools or DataTools folder, and restarting CellProfiler."

     -Done- When adding a module to the pipeline, check to see whether more than one function with that name exists on the Matlab search path. If so, warn the user, tell the user which pathname to the function will most likely be used, but warn them that this may change if the path is changed by adding modules from another directory.  Suggest that if the module has the same name as a Matlab function, they should consider renaming the module to prevent confusion.

     -Done- When adding a module to the pipeline, CellProfiler checks in a fairly rudimentary way whether it is a valid CellProfiler module and warns the user. However, the module is then half-loaded so nothing works properly and you have to restart CellProfiler. This checking should be more sophisticated, and should recover by not loading the module at all.

     -Done- In CellProfiler.m, check whether the guidata lines are necessary (marked with a TODO).  (They were unnecessary)

     DONE!! - Allow the Save Images module to deal with different bit depths, in case the user wants to save images in 16-bit (e.g. with PNG or JPG). Also allow the user to save an image as a binary (black/white rather than grayscale, so that any nonzero pixels = 1, most useful for viewing a label matrix).

     -Almost done- Timer: Have the time for first set separate from the time for
       subsequent sets. 

     -Done- Make progress bar windows go away when using the close all figures and timers button (e.g. Correct illum modules).

     - done Have LoadSettings button determine whether a file is a valid Settings file.

    - Done "Make projection" module (= average, get code from DivideAllMean). 

     -Done-   adjusted the Show data on image button or the Show image button
       to load DIB images. Also need to adjust any other modules
       that use imread, including those which open all the images to
       calculate something, like CorrectIllum All modules and probably
       IdentifyPrimThreshold and ApplyThreshold (when the threshold is 
       automatically calculated).  Also, DIB's are currently being read
       upside down - need to flip them (flipud).

Done     - Throughout CellProfiler and its modules, remove unnecessary updating of the handles structure (guidata function).
