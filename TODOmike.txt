Mike's TODO list

- Sometime in early August we should assess whether we would like to invite Jun and Rodrigo to stay on during the fall semester.

- Cell size - Fly200 (do not trust alignment) and NIRHT (dont trust spreading/crowding). Should we at least look at the controls for cell size?  Let's discuss at imaging subgroup.

- Help Robert pick out cell cycle, cell count, cell size, phospho-S6, synthetic hits & give to lab members for biological follow up. (probably Adam will help here too, with normalization, etc.)

- Follow-up Human funky phenotype hits: (1) RNA level/phenotype correlation for original shRNAs, (2) order more shRNAs and repeat, (3) interpret the lists of genes and design  specific biological follow up experiments.

- Merck screens (image acquisition and analysis only)

--------------
- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES

- As we discovered, Plate fix in the Crop module works to force the coordinates to be used each time freshly (when doing rectangle, coordinates). Can you describe in the help why/how this works? I guess in my case none of the rows/columns were 50% empty, so the real purpose of Plate fix was thwarted, while the cute side benefit of repeating use of the coordinates was used?
