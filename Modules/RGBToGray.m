    %%% The "drawnow" function executes any pending figure window-related
    %%% commands.  In general, Matlab does not update figure windows
    %%% until breaks between image analysis modules, or when a few select
    %%% commands are used. "figure" and "drawnow" are two of the commands
    %%% that allow Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window-
    %%% related commands (like zooming, or pressing timer pause or cancel
    %%% buttons or pressing a help button.)  If the drawnow command is not
    %%% used immediately prior to the figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber) line,
    %%% then immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands
    %%% that have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then,
    %%% when Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line,
    %%% the figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one.
    %%% This results in strange things like the subplots appearing in the
    %%% timer window or in the wrong figure window, or in help dialog boxes.
