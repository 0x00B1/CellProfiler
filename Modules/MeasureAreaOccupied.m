function handles = AlgMeasureAreaOccupied(handles)

% Help for the Measure Area Occupied module: 
% 
% This module simply measures the total area covered by stain in an
% image. 
%
% How it works:
% This module applies a threshold to the incoming image so that any
% pixels brighter than the specified value are assigned the value 1
% (white) and the remaining pixels are assigned the value zero
% (black), producing a binary image.  The number of white pixels are
% then counted.  This provides a measurement of the area occupied by
% fluorescence.  The threshold is calculated automatically and then
% adjusted by a user-specified factor. It might be desirable to write
% a new module where the threshold can be set to a constant value.

    %%% that allow Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window-

    %%% used immediately prior to the figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber) line,
    %%% then immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands
    %%% that have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then,
    %%% when Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line,
    %%% the figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one.
