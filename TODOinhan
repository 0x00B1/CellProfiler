   Figure out how to make font sizes uniform on PC vs Unix vs Mac.

   Change CellProfiler.m code to preallocate if possible, relating to the following variables (line numbers are approximate).
L 1391 (C 29-40): Array 'Measurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1485 (C 9-28): Array 'EditedMeasFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1514 (C 9-31): Array 'EditedHeadingFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1982 (C 13-28): Array 'PlotBinLocations' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1991 (C 45-55): Array 'XTickLabels' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2073 (C 17-34): Array 'ListOfMeasurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2532 (C 13-32): Array 'EditedMeasFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2578 (C 25-49): Array 'EditedPotentialImageNames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2886 (C 25-31): Array 'Pending' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 3112 (C 25-31): Array 'Lengths' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed

   Determine whether lines near the variable 'contents' can be removed from CellProfiler.m .   

   Load settings from an output file works now, but Load settings from a settings file no longer works and it yields this error:
??? Reference to non-existent field 'Valgorithmname'.
Error in ==> CellProfiler>LoadSettingsFromFileButton_Callback at 561
   handles.Settings.Valgorithmname = Settings.Valgorithmname;
Error in ==> gui_mainfcn at 75
        feval(varargin{:});
Error in ==> CellProfiler at 56
    gui_mainfcn(gui_State, varargin{:});

   Move Algorithms and Variables to arrays, and to handles.Settings
      substructure  (in VariableArrayBranch) [BETA, Anne thinks]

   Refine List box [BETA]
   
   Fix close/open figure button [BETA]

   Fix the "FIXME" sections in CellProfiler, unless Ray wanted to do it himself
   
   Add scroll bar interface to allow > 11 variables

   "Make projection" module (= average, get code from DivideAllMean). Did In Han finish this already?  If so, make a manual page.

   RGB to Grayscale module [BETA]

   Rescale intensity image (stretch histogram)

   Make closefigures and openfigures not global if possible.
