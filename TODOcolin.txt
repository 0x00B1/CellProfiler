Colin's TODO list


Colin is working on this?? - (Requested by Anne 8-29-05) - Add a check box to the main GUI (in the space near pixel size) for 'Diagnostic mode'. This would basically be like running the SpeedUpCellProfiler module option that strips out the handles.Pipeline just before saving the output file which dramatically reduces the output file size. I think people rarely want the contents of the Pipeline unless they are actually intensively writing a new module, so mostly it just adds a ton of extra data to the file.  The default should be to *not* run in diagnostic mode, and there should be a '?' button nearby telling the user what this does (the SpeedUpCellProfiler module might have a description you could copy & paste).


****************
- (Requested by Anne) - Many of the identify modules produce object outlines on top of the original image. I would like to change all of these so that the outlines only (without the underlying grayscale image) are saved in the handles structure (maybe as logical/binary images?) and then you can overlay them on an image using a separate module. This allows more flexibility. (for example, identify well spots doesn't know what the 'original image' is so it can't display outlines on an original image). It also reduces the size of the image stored in the handles structure, since it would be a logical format rather than full 8 bit, but that's a minor advantage. To accomplish this, we should make a module 'AddImages' that can add two images' pixel values in the normal manner but also has an option to make one of the images' nonzero values be either (a) the maximum allowed value for a particular image format (e.g. 255 for 8 bit images) or (b) the maximum of the grayscale image (e.g. if an image has values from 0 to 0.17, the binary outlines would be assigned the value 0.17). We have already made this change for IdentifyEasy but we need to do a similar thing for the other IdentifyPrim and Sec and Tertiary modules (there is currently a push in progress to merge all identifyprim modules into IdentifyEasy and all IdentifySec modules into one, so perhaps check that first).
This also affects the "SAVING IMAGES" portion of the help for each module, so update the other modules' help using IdentifyEasy's as a template.

- (Requested by Anne) - In a similar manner, many identify modules produce a label matrix image and there is an option to save this image in colored label matrix format. I'd like to take this feature out of each individual identify module (it adds another image to the handles structure which takes up space) and instead have the SaveImages module have an option to convert a label matrix to color. Perhaps we can then also have an option in SaveImages to choose the colormap to be used for this conversion. It's useful to take it out of each individual identify module because it's not very common that someone actually wants to save or use the colored label matrix downstream. It's usually just for display purposes during processing. This also is one less thing to make sure is present in every Identify module.

- (Requested by Anne 8-24-05) I HAVE STARTED ADDRESSING THE ABOVE CONCERNS IN THIS MANNER - I have written QuickFixConvertObjectsToImage module. We should develop this further so that it can be used to convert objects into images that are savable by SaveImages. It should also be able to convert objects to images in order to pass them down the pipeline (because if you wanted to process a label matrix image downstream, you can't select its object name in downstream modules because only imagegroup members are selectable in downstream modules). The ability to use this module with the SaveImages module will replace the last few variables and related code from each individual Identify module which will be more streamlined. This module should include options (1) convert entire objects or just outlines, (2) binary, grayscale in range 0 to 1 (be sure to think about what happens if there's more than 256 objects), or RGB. For RGB, allow the user to choose which colormap (e.g. jet, bone, autumn, etc).  We might even include an option to allow overlaying outlines on some image, because that's really handy.


- (Requested by Anne 8-30-05) - What is the last variable talking about in SaveImages.m ? "Do you want to update file names within CellProfiler?"   This should be described in the help - I have no idea what it's referring to.
