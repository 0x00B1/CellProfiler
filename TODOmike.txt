Mike's TODO list

J Biology paper:
- Find new shape weirdo from NIRHT using CellVisualizer, preferably a Zernike one (medium order might work best) if you can find one. Take care to find an example where it's not the area that is the real difference, because a lot of shape measures correlate to area. Add to figure 3.

- Move Fig 3A and C to a supplemental figure, and label the x axes with numbers.

- Make x axis marks more visible for figure 2A/B. Figure out if it's log base 2 or 10 and label appropriately?

- In Jason's 06_14 NIRHT re-analysis, it appears that the Neighbors module is putting a bunch of underscores in the feature names. There should only be underscores when separating things that should be in pulldown menus, so surrounding "and" with underscores gives you a silly pulldown menu where you have to choose "and". Fixing the correlation module to remove "and" would be good too, as long as you are preparing a new release.

- Compile and release fresh version of CellProfiler.

New 6-21-06: Don't forget to have the UROPs do code review, where they each go through each module and look for inefficiencies and make sure there are good error messages, and most importantly check that the help is complete and understandable, etc. I guess we should wait until they have been here a month or so.

- Check that all the pipelines posted on the web are up to date with the code that is on the web (UROPs can do?) - I was worried about Neighbors, but I guess we haven't posted a new version of code so maybe it is not a problem. In the meantime, the UROPs could test all pipe's with the current code and update things so they are ready for the next release?
--------------
- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES

- Tell people at lab meeting about our storage closet downstairs. I think most people don't know.

- As we discovered, Plate fix in the Crop module works to force the coordinates to be used each time freshly (when doing rectangle, coordinates). Can you describe in the help why/how this works? I guess in my case none of the rows/columns were 50% empty, so the real purpose of Plate fix was thwarted, while the cute side benefit of repeating use of the coordinates was used?
