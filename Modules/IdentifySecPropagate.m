% Help for the Identify Secondary Propagate module:
% Category: Object Identification
% 
% This module identifies secondary objects based on a previous
% module's identification of primary objects.  Each primary object is
% assumed to be completely within a secondary object (e.g. nuclei
% within cells stained for actin).  The module is especially good at
% determining the dividing lines between clustered secondary objects.
% The dividing lines between objects are determined by a combination
% of the distance to the nearest primary object and intensity
% gradients (dividing lines can be either dim or bright). 
%
% Settings:
%
% Threshold: this setting affects the stringency of object outlines
% that border the background.  It does not affect the dividing lines
% between clumped objects. A higher number will result in smaller
% objects (more stringent). A lower number will result in large
% objects (less stringent).
%
% Regularization factor: This module takes two factors into account
% when deciding where to draw the dividing line between two touching
% secondary objects: the distance to the nearest primary object, and
% the intensity of the secondary object image.  The regularization
% factor controls the balance between these two considerations: A
% value of zero means that the distance to the nearest primary object
% is ignored and the decision is made entirely on the intensity
% gradient between the two competing primary objects. Larger values
% weight the distance between the two values more and more heavily.
% The regularization factor can be infinitely large, but around 10 or
% so, the intensity image is almost completely ignored and the
% dividing line will simply be halfway between the two competing
% primary objects.
% 
% Note: Primary segmenters produce two output images that are used by
% this module.  The Segmented image contains the final, edited
% primary objects (i.e. objects at the border and those that are too
% small or large have been excluded).  The PrelimSmallSegmented
% image is the same except that the objects at the border and the
% large objects have been included.  These extra objects are used to
% perform the identification of secondary object outlines, since they
% are probably real objects (even if we don't want to measure them).
% Small objects are not used at this stage because they are more
% likely to be artifactual, and so they therefore should not "claim"
% any secondary object pixels.
% 
% TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM: 
% Propagate labels from LABELS_IN to LABELS_OUT, steered by IMAGE and 
% limited to MASK.  MASK should be a logical array.  LAMBDA is a 
% regularization parameter, larger being closer to Euclidean distance
% in the image plane, and zero being entirely controlled by IMAGE. 
% Propagation of labels is by shortest path to a nonzero label in
% LABELS_IN.  Distance is the sum of absolute differences in the image
% in a 3x3 neighborhood, combined with LAMBDA via sqrt(differences^2 +
% LAMBDA^2).  Note that there is no separation between adjacent areas
% with different labels (as there would be using, e.g., watershed).
% Such boundaries must be added in a postprocess.
%
% What does Secondary mean?
% Identify Primary modules identify objects without relying on any
% information other than a single grayscale input image (e.g. nuclei
% are typically primary objects). Identify Secondary modules require a
% grayscale image plus an image where primary objects have already
% been identified, because the secondary objects' locations are
% determined in part based on the primary objects (e.g. cells can be
% secondary objects). Identify Tertiary modules require images where
% two sets of objects have already been identified (e.g. nuclei and
% cell regions are used to define the cytoplasm objects, which are
% tertiary objects).
%
% SAVING IMAGES: The images of the objects produced by this module can
% be easily saved using the Save Images module using the name:
% Segmented + whatever you called the objects (e.g. SegmentedCells).
% This will be a grayscale image where each object is a different
% intensity.
% 
% Several additional images are normally calculated for display only,
% including the colored label matrix image (the objects displayed as
% arbitrary colors), object outlines, and object outlines overlaid on
% the original image, and object outlines plus primary object outlines
% on the original image. These images can be saved by altering the
% code for this module to save those images to the handles structure
% (see the SaveImages module help) and then using the Save Images
% module.  Important note: The calculations of these display images
% are only performed if the figure window is open, so the figure
% window must be left open or the Save Images module will fail.  If
% you are running the job on a cluster, figure windows are not open,
% so the Save Images module will also fail, unless you go into the
% code for this module and remove the 'if/end' statement surrounding
% the DISPLAY RESULTS section.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HELP:
% The first unbroken block of lines will be extracted as help by
% CellProfiler's 'Help for this analysis module' button as well as
% Matlab's built in 'help' and 'doc' functions at the command line. It
% will also be used to automatically generate a manual page for the
% module. An example image demonstrating the function of the module
% can also be saved in tif format, using the same name as the
% algorithm (minus Alg), and it will automatically be included in the
% manual page as well.  Follow the convention of: purpose of the
% module, description of the variables and acceptable range for each,
% how it works (technical description), info on which images can be 
% saved, and See also CAPITALLETTEROTHERALGORITHMS. The license/author
% information should be separated from the help lines with a blank
% line so that it does not show up in the help displays.  Do not
% change the programming notes in any modules! These are standard
% across all modules for maintenance purposes, so anything
% module-specific should be kept separate.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW:
% The 'drawnow' function allows figure windows to be updated and
% buttons to be pushed (like the pause, cancel, help, and view
% buttons).  The 'drawnow' function is sprinkled throughout the code
% so there are plenty of breaks where the figure windows/buttons can
% be interacted with.  This does theoretically slow the computation
% somewhat, so it might be reasonable to remove most of these lines
% when running jobs on a cluster where speed is important.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% VARIABLE BOXES AND TEXT: 
% The '%textVAR' lines contain the text which is displayed in the GUI
% next to each variable box. The '%defaultVAR' lines contain the
% default values which are displayed in the variable boxes when the
% user loads the algorithm. The line of code after the textVAR and
% defaultVAR extracts the value that the user has entered from the
% handles structure and saves it as a variable in the workspace of
% this algorithm with a descriptive name. The syntax is important for
% the %textVAR and %defaultVAR lines: be sure there is a space before
% and after the equals sign and also that the capitalization is as
% shown.  Don't allow the text to wrap around to another line; the
% second line will not be displayed.  If you need more space to
% describe a variable, you can refer the user to the help file, or you
% can put text in the %textVAR line above or below the one of
% interest, and do not include a %defaultVAR line so that the variable
% edit box for that variable will not be displayed; the text will
% still be displayed. CellProfiler is currently being restructured to
% handle more than 11 variable boxes. Keep in mind that you can have
% several inputs into the same box: for example, a box could be
% designed to receive two numbers separated by a comma, as long as you
% write a little extraction algorithm that separates the input into
% two distinct variables.  Any extraction algorithms like this should
% be within the VARIABLES section of the code, at the end.

%%% SAVE DATA TO HANDLES STRUCTURE %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
%       In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent
% function (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see'
% variables produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared
% from one module to the next, they must be saved to what is called
% the 'handles structure'. This is a variable, whose class is
% 'structure', and whose name is handles. Data which should be saved
% to the handles structure within each module includes: any images,
% data or measurements which are to be eventually saved to the hard
% drive (either in an output file, or using the SaveImages module) or
% which are to be used by a later module in the analysis pipeline. Any
% module which produces or passes on an image needs to also pass along
% the original filename of the image, named after the new image name,
% so that if the SaveImages module attempts to save the resulting
% image, it can be named by appending text to the original file name.
% handles.Pipeline is for storing data which must be retrieved by other modules.
% This data can be overwritten as each image set is processed, or it
% can be generated once and then retrieved during every subsequent image
% set's processing, or it can be saved for each image set by
% saving it according to which image set is being analyzed.
%       Anything stored in handles.Measurements or handles.Pipeline
% will be deleted at the end of the analysis run, whereas anything
% stored in handles.Settings will be retained from one analysis to the
% next. It is important to think about which of these data should be
% deleted at the end of an analysis run because of the way Matlab
% saves variables: For example, a user might process 12 image sets of
% nuclei which results in a set of 12 measurements ("TotalNucArea")
% stored in the handles structure. In addition, a processed image of
% nuclei from the last image set is left in the handles structure
% ("SegmNucImg"). Now, if the user uses a different algorithm which
% happens to have the same measurement output name "TotalNucArea" to
% analyze 4 image sets, the 4 measurements will overwrite the first 4
% measurements of the previous analysis, but the remaining 8
% measurements will still be present. So, the user will end up with 12
% measurements from the 4 sets. Another potential problem is that if,
% in the second analysis run, the user runs only an algorithm which
% depends on the output "SegmNucImg" but does not run an algorithm
% that produces an image by that name, the algorithm will run just
% fine: it will just repeatedly use the processed image of nuclei
% leftover from the last image set, which was left in the handles
% structure ("SegmNucImg").
%       Note that two types of measurements are typically made: Object
% and Image measurements.  Object measurements have one number for
% every object in the image (e.g. ObjectArea) and image measurements
% have one number for the entire image, which could come from one
% measurement from the entire image (e.g. ImageTotalIntensity), or
% which could be an aggregate measurement based on individual object
% measurements (e.g. ImageMeanArea).  Use the appropriate prefix to
% ensure that your data will be extracted properly.
%       Saving measurements: The data extraction functions of
% CellProfiler are designed to deal with only one "column" of data per
% named measurement field. So, for example, instead of creating a
% field of XY locations stored in pairs, they should be split into a field
% of X locations and a field of Y locations. Measurements must be
% stored in double format, because the extraction part of the program
% is designed to deal with that type of array only, not cell or
% structure arrays. It is wise to include the user's input for
% 'ObjectName' as part of the fieldname in the handles structure so
% that multiple modules can be run and their data will not overwrite
% each other.
%       Extracting measurements: handles.Measurements.CenterXNuclei{1}(2) gives
% the X position for the second object in the first image.
% handles.Measurements.AreaNuclei{2}(1) gives the area of the first object in
% the second image.
