- (Anne 9-1-06): Could you confirm that our Zernike's are now area-normalized properly, before our next public release (will probably release ~Friday 9-8-06)?  Bayraktar Rajwa Robinson SPIE 2005 (Feature extraction for cellular shape analysis...) has a section (2.2.1) about scale normalization that might be helpful.

- (Anne 9-1-06): Figure out how to make texture measures somewhat more invariant to mean or integrated intensity. Discussed with Ola, he explained that it's not entirely possible, most likely.

- (Anne 9-1-06): Several texture measures came out equal to 1 for every image: Contrast, InformationMeasure1, and DifferenceVariance, for the Dros movie in the paper and probably for our images overall. [Anne asked Ola 1/9/06 but he replied he doesn't know why and suggested we change the scale of texture]. 

- (Anne 9-1-06): Polish up the Loopy belief propagation for thresholding so we can start using it routinely.

- (Anne 9-1-06): Polish up the new illumination correction method so we can start using it routinely. Also, when we run large image sets, we usually run an illumination correction pipeline. It would be nice if this pipeline would calculate a suggested 'minimum allowable threshold', to be used in the IdentifyPrim and IdentifySec modules. Right now, we choose it empirically. Actually, displaying/saving a histogram of pixel intensity values across the entire image set would be useful too. Perhaps this will be built into the CorrectIllumCalc_New, rather than requiring a separate module.

- (Anne 9-1-06): [YOU SHOULD TAKE A QUICK LOOK JUST TO SEE IF THEY ARE USEFUL - IF SO, PUT ON MAIN TODO FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO IMPLEMENT]: Look at Matlab central to see if any of these are useful/faster than
what we have: auto image registration using mutual information (x2),
Graph analysis toolbox, multivariate analysis multispectral

[YOU CAN DELETE THIS - IT MOVED TO ADAM'S TO DO]- decide on what normalization is appropriate and build a tool in CellVisualizer to do it so we can feed normalized data into the database.  Note: we have usually been smoothing the pattern across the slide overall. We should also talk to  Robert to figure out the pattern of the printhead and then look at non-smoothed data in relation to printhead position to see whether there are any consistent patterns there.

- [DISCUSS WITH ADAM AND POSSIBLY HAVE HIM WORK ON IT IF USEFUL]: Investigate non-parametric population-comparison stats: Kolmogorov-Smirnov vs Kullback-Leibler. Have CellVisualizer calculate them for us and deposit into the database?

- [DISCUSS WITH ADAM AND POSSIBLY HAVE HIM WORK ON IT IF USEFUL]: Try clustering based on KS statistics or per-cell data or whatever you think is most useful.

- Test and write up new illumination correction method.

- Test and write up loopy belief propagation method.

- Write chapter with Anne, due February 2007. Probably we will wait til January to start working on it, and Anne can do most of the writing if you want, given a framework.

- Write thesis.  :)
