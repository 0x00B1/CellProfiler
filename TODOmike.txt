Mike's TODO list

-*Really, Really, Ridiculously, Important* (Anne 5/10/06) - Is it possible to add the following measurement to the MeasureObjectNeighbors module:
What is the distance to the nearest two neighboring objects?
what are the vectors to the nearest two neighbors?
What are the indices (ObjectNumbers) of the two nearest neighbors? 
How many of its border pixels are bordering other objects? DONE

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- RUN TEST PRE-ALLOCATING HANDLES.MEASUREMENTS.OBJECT.INTENSITY{1:NUMBEROFIMAGESETS} TO SEE IF THERE IS SIGNFICANT TIME REDUCTION.
EDIT: INSTEAD, TRY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES FOR HANDLES, THEN AT END OF IMAGE ANALYSIS COMBINE SEPERATE VARIABLES
