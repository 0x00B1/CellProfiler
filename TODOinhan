   Cancel after module doesn't work anymore!

   In addition to the automatic sizing of long edit boxes, allow us to add a flag to edit boxes to force them to be long.  Then, go through modules looking for variables using the 11th slot (which used to be long) and add the flag.

   For modules that have very long help descriptions when selecting the module in the listbox and clicking "Help for this analysis module", the text does not fit into the window.  Esp. see AlgIdentifySecPropagate.m's help

   Figure out how to make font sizes uniform on PC vs Unix vs Mac. [BETA]

   Change CellProfiler.m code to preallocate if possible, relating to the following variables (line numbers are approximate).
L 1391 (C 29-40): Array 'Measurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1485 (C 9-28): Array 'EditedMeasFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1514 (C 9-31): Array 'EditedHeadingFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1982 (C 13-28): Array 'PlotBinLocations' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 1991 (C 45-55): Array 'XTickLabels' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2073 (C 17-34): Array 'ListOfMeasurements' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2532 (C 13-32): Array 'EditedMeasFieldnames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2578 (C 25-49): Array 'EditedPotentialImageNames' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 2886 (C 25-31): Array 'Pending' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed
L 3112 (C 25-31): Array 'Lengths' is constructed using subscripting. Consider preallocating for speed 

   Fix the "FIXME" sections in CellProfiler, unless Ray wanted to do it himself
   
   Add scroll bar interface to allow > 11 variables

   "Make projection" module (= average, get code from DivideAllMean). Did In Han finish this already?  If so, make a manual page.

   Rescale intensity image (stretch histogram)

   Make closefigures and openfigures not global if possible.
