To add new users:\

\cf0 \ulnone Anne needs to login to login.csail.mit.edu:   ssh -X anniebio@login.csail.mit.edu\
And then run the command:\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 htpasswd /afs/csail/group/vision/cellprofiler/.htpasswd <username>\

\ul To set up a computer with the CellProfiler directory cvs'd (for PC):\
\ulnone Download and install with all options TortoiseSVN from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/\
Checkout new copy entering: http://svn.csail.mit.edu/cellprofiler/CellProfiler/trunk\
This will create a trunk/CellProfiler directory on your computer. All commands can now be done by right clicking the folder/file of interest (ignore all the SVN command line instructions below).\
In Matlab, be sure to set the path to include this new folder & its subfolders as follows:\
File-->Set Path --> Add with Subfolders--> choose CellProfiler folder --> save\
You can save your username/password by checking the box that appears after your first update.\
\
\ul To set up a computer with the CellProfiler directory cvs'd (for Mac):\
\ulnone Download and install the latest Mac os X package version at http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/     (as of Sept 2005, this is version 1.2.3  up)\
After installation finishes, open the terminal and cd to /Users/youraccount/ (and whatever subfolder you want CellProfiler to be installed in), and type:\
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\
The first time you are settings this up, type the following to check out CellProfiler to your local computer:\
svn co http://svn.csail.mit.edu/cellprofiler/CellProfiler/trunk\
This will create a trunk/CellProfiler directory on your computer. At that point you can edit, commit changes, etc. (see commands below).\
In Matlab, be sure to set the path to include this new folder & its subfolders as follows:\
File-->Set Path --> Add with Subfolders--> choose CellProfiler folder --> save\

\cf0 If you get an error message says that the pathdef.m can't be saved , you have to change the permissions for the Matlab folder first. To do that (in Finder) right click on MatLab folder  --> Get Info --> change the owner to yourself. Close the Get Info window. Reopen the Get Info for MatLab folder, change the owner to system(root), be sure to allow group and others to read and write. (The GetInfo tool in Finder is a little buggy - that's why you have to open/reopen. You can also chmod using the command line if you know how).\

-------------------------\
\ul SVN commands\ulnone \
Overall, to reconcile your local copy with the central svn copy, first update yourself (retrieve other people's changes), then check for differences between your version and the central version (optional), then commit (submit your changes to the central version).\
\
To run any svn commands, in terminal, change to the directory where CellProfiler resides.  You may need to type this command if it can't find the SVN program:\
export $PATH=PATH:/usr/local/bin\
\ul \
To update (get up-to-date code):\ulnone  svn update\
\
\ul To show what differences exist between your copy and the last central copy you checked out: \ulnone svn diff\
\
\ul To show what differences exist between particular revision numbers\ulnone \
svn diff -r REVNUMBER REVNUMBER  (providing only one revision number will compare to your locally modified copy, I think)\
\
\ul If you get "it is in the way" errors:\
\ulnone If you don't have any local modifications that you need to commit, just remove the parent directory altogether and then svn update -d to restore a fresh version of the folder.\
\
\ul To obtain revision numbers:\
\ulnone svn log Filename.m\
\
\ul To commit changes one by one: (\ulnone leave off the specific filename to commit all)\
svn commit -m "Description of this change" filename.m\
\ul \
To add a file which is not already in the central copy:\ulnone \
svn add filename.m\
(this only adds it to your local svn list, not the central one, so the next step is to svn commit)\
\
\ul To lock a file so that only you can commit to it:\ulnone \
svn admin -l filename\
When you check in a new version, the lock will be unlocked by default,\
so you'll have to do it again.\
\
\ul To remove a file from the repository:\
\ulnone svn update filename.m\
move the file from the directory\
svn remove filename.m\
svn commit filename.m\
\
\ul To rename a file without losing all the SVN history:\
\ulnone Of course you can svn add with the new name and svn remove the old name, but this will lose all the SVN history.  So instead, you need to go to the computer which has the repository: \
cp oldfile.c,v newfile.c,v\
now go to your working directory and do a svn update; newfile.c will appear as a new file. Now you can svn delete oldfile.c and commit.\
\ul To see a list of all files and their status:\
\ulnone svn status}
