\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mike's TODO list\
\
- (Requested by Anne 8-23-05) - Go through the code looking for instances of the term "image set" and replace with "cycle" where appropriate.\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - There is a general popupmenu bug: for example, in ImageTiler, if I load this module after loading other modules (like SaveImages) and leave the default "TiledImage" as it is, this 'TiledImage' option does not automatically show up in the SaveImages module as an image I can choose. The workaround is simply to click on the TiledImage text in the  ImageTiler module. This refreshes the popup menu in the saveimages module so that the TiledImage can now be selected. Another popupmenu bug: To reproduce, first add for example IdentifyPrimIntensIntens to the pipeline, close the add module window, and then add for example the LoadImagesText module. Move the LoadImagesText module to the top. Now it is still not possible to choose an input image in the IdentifyPrimIntensIntens module. This problem might have the same root case.\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - variable bug: for IdentifyPrimIntenIntens (and possibly other modules), there is a problem with the variable - what do you want to call the labeled matrix image?  Typing in a custom entry using the 'Other...' option yields an error. See that module for more details on the error produced.  Perhaps we decided that this bug is not worth fixing, in which case remove the comments there and convert any other similar situations in other modules so that this error does not occur.  Note: We have replaced IdentifyPrimIntenIntens with IdentifyEasy recently. We still want to fix the problem because a similar thing occurs in IdentifyEasy but you will still want to take a look at the code in IdentifyPrimIntenIntens because the bug is described in detail in there (see Outdated folder).\
\
- When loading a module whose variable revision number has changed, many of the variables come up as blank in the window where you choose between Saved and Default.\
\
NOTE FOR THE ABOVE BUGS: There is a line marked FIXME in CellProfiler.m that might explain some of these issues.\
\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - Maybe make new pipelines to show off different features of CellProfiler if desired (e.g. the SpotIdentifier or yeast colony finding). [Anne recently did yeast colony finding and human nuclei - we can spruce these up just prior to release, so maybe put this back on the general TODO towards the bottom where we have "Pre-release" stuff to do.\

- (Requested by Anne) - Adjust the boilerplate of authors in each m file:\

   Susan Ma\
\
- (Requested by Anne) - In several places there is text information entered as a variable description that does not need a corresponding variable box (see SaveImages for an example). A box with the text 'n/a' appears next to these variable descriptions that is unnecessary.  This seems odd - can we make it so the variable box doesn't appear if it is n/a?  I think maybe the reason it is done this way is to be sure that if you scroll down using the slider this extra text information is displayed properly.\
