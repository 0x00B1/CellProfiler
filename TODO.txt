CellProfiler cell image analysis software development 
November 8, 2005

- (Requested by Anne 11-09-05) - Why does module checks say "Change handles structure?"

- (Requested by Anne 11-09-05) - Hi - not sure if I put this on already: When exporting data with features as rows, the wait bar doesn't display anything. It's ok if that doesn't work, but since exporting takes a long time I think most people will think it froze and try to quit. We should have the waitbar display a msg saying it takes a really long time and be patient.

- (Requested by Anne 11-09-05) - I don't think we want all our email addresses on the Boilerplate of each file. You know, too much fan mail and all that.   :)   Instead we should just have our names plus the website, right?

- (Wyman?)Make sure all modules are using error and not errordlg

- Make compiled CellProfiler work on cluster

-Update pipelines for new threshold

-Fix ellipse by clicking points in crop module

- (Requested by Anne 11-08-05) - Long-term, maybe UROP: Can we make PlotMeasurements as cool as Histograms? e.g. selecting subsets of images, 'gating' by plotting only cells above a threshold in a particular measurement.

- (Requested by Anne 11-08-05) -  FilterByObject Measurement fails if there are no objects in an image.

- (Requested by Anne 11-02-05) - Susan will eventually work on making ExportData (datatool) into a module.  Is it possible in a general way to make all our data tools easily wrapped so they can be run as modules as well? I think perhaps the easiest way to accomplish this would be to write all the data tools as modules, and then when running them as a data tool, pass the module a fake handles structure.

- (Requested by Anne 11-08-05) - When you load a non-valid settings file, you get an error message, but the text "Loading" still appears in the pipeline listbox, and it seems to me that there are variables and stuff left loaded in handles.Settings - maybe because I previously had some modules in the pipeline when I tried loading a new one?

-(EXPAND OR SHRINK FIXED) (Requested by Anne 11-08-05) - Expand or Shrink does not have the option to save outlines. Can you add it and also check any other object processing modules (this is for the general TODO, not steve's but maybe it's quick to check it while you are doing this) to be sure they all are capable of saving outlines properly, and *not* saving colored objects?

- Browse buttons now move when adding or subtracting modules, but should check when deleting modules and also what about callback function for these buttons when the module number changes? Does this change the value in the wrong modules?

UROP:

- Make the help/manual prettier: For each example image that is just text, type the text into the help for that file instead of referring to the image, because as it is these images are stretched a lot.

- Check through each module (~2 per day):
EVERYONE:
	- Go through the code looking for instances of the term "image set" and
		replace with "cycle" where appropriate.
	- (Requested by Anne) - Test each module on color vs grayscale and make
		sure they all work or have some type of error catching.
	- (Requested by Anne 9-01-05) - We'd like to make the variable descriptions
		consistent - at the very least we should try to be consistent with
		stating "Choose" (rather than "select"), and phrasing things as
		questions versus "Enter the ..."   Also, look through the variable
		descriptions for uses of computer-ific words like 'segmentation'.
	- Write help if DNE
	- Check that fontsize is never hard-coded and instead uses the user's preference.
MIKE:
	- Make sure all code is using CPfigure rather than figure. I think the
		DataLayout tool in particular is using figure.
	- Smart Indent
	- M Lint error checking
	- (Requested by Anne)- IdentifyPrimAutomatic has a nice thing when you click
		on one of the images within the figure that allows you to open in its
		own window, etc. We should implement this feature into all the modules.
---------------------------------------------------
JUST PRIOR TO PUBLIC RELEASE:
- Make the download new modules work - I think it should also download new CellProfiler.m and ImageTools and DataTools, etc.
- Prepare updated manual
- Check whether canceling works 
- Make reference sheet with short descriptions of the modules.
- For each common application (e.g. cell count, yeast colony count, staining intensity, cell cycle, nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation) and cell type (e.g. human, yeast, drosophila), make an example pipeline file and a nice pdf document showing the results: We should use the 'test mode' option in IdentifyPrimAutomatic to show all the possibilities, and then show results from the ideal pipeline. This will give people a good starting place for their images. Anne has example images and starting points for new pipelines in the ExampleFlyImages folder.
- Design an informational brochure
- Make a tutorial to demonstrate how CP is used.
- copy CP code onto CDs for Colin to take to ASCB meeting in San Francisco.
Sites that review and list software:
www.zdnet.com	downloads.mycomputer.com	www.windows95.sk
directory.google.com	www.libpng.org	cn.tech.yahoo.com
www.dmoz.org	softload.narod.ru	www.chinabyte.com
www.winsite.com	www.cheta.net www.open-bio.org 
- Submit CellProfiler to caBIG (check license terms and maybe use them instead of GPL.
- Get the email addresses of all corresponding authors from all the research articles Anne has collected, and also microscope facility directors and send them an email telling them to visit cellprofiler.org and sign up for the email list if desired.
- The Broad institute has done a lot of thinking and infrastructure for distributing free software. They have narrowed down to 3 licenses (GPL, a variant of academic open source, and one other) that their scientists use and they also have pages to help register users who download their software etc. this might be useful for us.

---------------------------------------------------
POST-PUBLIC RELEASE SUPPORT:
     - Monitor imaging newsgroups and inform people about the software
     - Provide technical support/help desk
     - Fix bugs
     - Maintain for new releases of OS's and Matlab
     - Check Matlab Central for useful code to incorporate into
       CellProfiler or its modules (last checked on 9-16-04:
       Biotech/medical, Graphics (all 3 categories), Image Processing,
       Utilities - GUI Tools & examples, and Misc.) 
     - Organize training workshops
     - Present at conferences, especially microscope facility director-oriented ones.
---------------------------------------------------
THINGS TO DO WHEN NEW VERSIONS OF MATLAB COME OUT:
- update the image file formats that are readable in LoadImages modules.
