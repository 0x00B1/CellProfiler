Mike's TODO list

- Fix Help problems in compiled CellProfiler

-(Requested by Anne 12-02-05) In Classify objects, it looks like display won't work if using Ratios. Does that still make sense, or is it outdated?

- Jason: Design method for scaling grid and getting locations

- Website: Include Forum on main page, think of layout

- Test SaveImageAs

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- New images for Scott Floyd

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.
