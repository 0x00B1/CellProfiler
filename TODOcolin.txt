Colin's TODO list

- IdentifySecondary needs to be fixed. New method of calculating outlines was merging objects. Come talk to Mike.

-(Colin, I put this on your list because I am pretty sure you took this functionality out after adding pathnameVAR. If you have too much stuff to do, just take a minute and come show me what exactly you took out because I am not sure what code it was. Thanks, -Mike)  (Requested by Anne 9-01-05) - We used to have code that allowed variable edit boxes to expand when the text within them was too long to fit. It mostly became unnecessary when Colin invented the new pathname entry boxes/browse buttons (because this usually only happens when we are dealing with typing pathnames into edit boxes), but I would still like edit boxes to expand if text becomes too long to fit, so we should find that code and re-implement it.

Colin is working on this?? - (Requested by Anne 8-29-05) - Add a check box to the main GUI (in the space near pixel size) for 'Diagnostic mode'. This would basically be like running the SpeedUpCellProfiler module option that strips out the handles.Pipeline just before saving the output file which dramatically reduces the output file size. I think people rarely want the contents of the Pipeline unless they are actually intensively writing a new module, so mostly it just adds a ton of extra data to the file.  The default should be to *not* run in diagnostic mode, and there should be a '?' button nearby telling the user what this does (the SpeedUpCellProfiler module might have a description you could copy & paste).

- (Requested by Anne) - In a similar manner, many identify modules produce a label matrix image and there is an option to save this image in colored label matrix format. I'd like to take this feature out of each individual identify module (it adds another image to the handles structure which takes up space) and instead have the SaveImages module have an option to convert a label matrix to color. Perhaps we can then also have an option in SaveImages to choose the colormap to be used for this conversion. It's useful to take it out of each individual identify module because it's not very common that someone actually wants to save or use the colored label matrix downstream. It's usually just for display purposes during processing. This also is one less thing to make sure is present in every Identify module.

- (Requested by Anne 8-24-05) I HAVE STARTED ADDRESSING THE ABOVE CONCERNS IN THIS MANNER - I have written QuickFixConvertObjectsToImage module. We should develop this further so that it can be used to convert objects into images that are savable by SaveImages. It should also be able to convert objects to images in order to pass them down the pipeline (because if you wanted to process a label matrix image downstream, you can't select its object name in downstream modules because only imagegroup members are selectable in downstream modules). The ability to use this module with the SaveImages module will replace the last few variables and related code from each individual Identify module which will be more streamlined. This module should include options (1) convert entire objects or just outlines, (2) binary, grayscale in range 0 to 1 (be sure to think about what happens if there's more than 256 objects), or RGB. For RGB, allow the user to choose which colormap (e.g. jet, bone, autumn, etc).  We might even include an option to allow overlaying outlines on some image, because that's really handy.


- (Requested by Anne 8-30-05) - What is the last variable talking about in SaveImages.m ? "Do you want to update file names within CellProfiler?"   This should be described in the help - I have no idea what it's referring to.
