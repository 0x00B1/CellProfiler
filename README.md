## How to file new issues

Most users should use the [CellProfiler forum](http://cellprofiler.org/forum/) to ask for help and report 
issues. We monitor the forum and may be able to help you find a workaround 
for the problem. If you have discovered a new bug, we will take care of 
filing a bug report on your behalf and include all necessary technical 
information.

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/issues) on Github is primarily for developer of CellProfiler 
and related software. There is a [special form](http://cellprofiler.org/issues/) for submitting new issues 
with attachments. If you use this form for reporting bugs, please attach 
sufficient information to reproduce the bug. For many bugs, it is appropriate 
to attach a CellProfiler pipeline and an image.
