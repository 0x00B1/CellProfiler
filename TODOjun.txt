- (Anne 6/12/06) - LoadSingleImage seems to spit its text display into other windows, depending on what you have open and are looking at. Maybe this a fluke, transient thing but perhaps we can make it put its text in the proper window more consistently? If we fix it for this module, make sure LoadImages is also working similarly.
