helpdlg(help('HelpPixelSize'))

% PIXEL SIZE IN MICROMETERS: 
% Enter the pixel size of the images.  This is based on the resolution
% and binning of the camera and the magnification of the objective
% lens. This number is used to convert measurements to micrometers
% instead of pixels. If you do not know the pixel size or you want the
% measurements to be reported in pixels, enter '1'. A default value
% can be remembered by CellProfiler by clicking on the 'Set
% preferences' button (see below).
