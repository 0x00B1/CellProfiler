				(Need to verify)

Rotate				    ,        Anne
Need to verify - check lots of combinations on an image of a grid of lines or something that is easy to verify that the rotation is really working properly, and that the X,Y (for coordinate) and clockwise/counterclockwise (for ANGLE) is stated correctly.
