TODO

- (Requested by Anne 2-22-06) - In ShowDataOnImage data tool, if you have produced an output file that uses LoadImages to access images in several different subdirectories, when it goes looking for the image automatically it cannot find it.  The image name is stored in the format SUBDIR/Imagename.tif or something like that, and even if SUBDIR exists and Imagename.tif is in that subfolder, it cannot open the image automatically for some reason - my guess is the construction of the path + filename is erroneous.


-(Mike 11/14 I think this can be done with invisible plot but i couldnt get it to work) (Requested by Anne) - Define grid: the row labels should be on the right (not left) and the column labels on the top (not bottom) so that the pixel locations are still visible on the left and bottom.


DONE
- Anne 7-12-06 (GOES WITH Mike 7-11-06): I added a new thresholding method to CPthreshold sbufunction, called Background. I have adjusted the help in IdentifyPrimAutomatic to describe this new method, and I have added Background Global to this list of choices selectable within IdentifyPrimAutomatic. There are several things to be done, though:
(1) I got it working only for the one combination I was using, which did not require any cropping. Make sure that using the Background Global option does the correct thing if you previously crop the image in a circle shape. When determining a threshold, CPthreshold should ignore parts of the image that have been cropped away, which have the value zero. This is why CPthreshold goes looking in the handles for an image called CropMaskBlabla. Right now, we are pretty sure CPthreshold is a bit of a mess in this regard. Some combinations of options work fine but others don't. So (see Mike's 7-11 request) this whole process needs some overhauling.
(2) Right now Background method only works in global mode, because if you choose Background adaptive, it is not sure how to deal with a cropmask (due to the block processing).
(3) Every module that uses thresholding will need to have this option added to its choiceVAR's and also have the help updated to include the description of this new option.

- Mike 7-11-06 (GOES WITH Anne 7-12-06): If using a cropped image, Identify modules use the crop mask when it calls CPthreshold to throw out things that have been cropped out. For instance, if you crop out a circle, you don't want to include anything outside of the circle since this will give a bad threshold. However, this fails when you want to do Adaptive Thresholding since the image is broken in to blocks before it produces a threshold, and the crop mask is the size of the original image. We want CPthreshold to be smart about adaptive thresholding, and if there is a cropmask in the handles, it should pad that image the same way the original image is padded and then sent to CPgraythresh.

OUTLINE OF ISSUES
-Circle Cropped Images
	- CPthreshold
		-throw out anything outside of the circle
		ALSO CONSIDER...
			-Adaptive thresholding (image is broken into blocks)
				-if there is a cropmask in handles, pad image the way the orig is, 					and send to CPgraythresh.
			-Background Global
				-make sure it works for circle cropped images
				-look in handles for cropmaskblablah
			-Background Adaptive
				-doesnt knwo what to do

(DONE 7/17- 7/21/06)
NOTES
-Adaptive thresholding (OTSU) fails because when CPgraythresh is accessed by blkproc, it does not pass in handles
-Added a subfunction that CPblkproc.  has same functions as matlab's blkproc.  The difference is that it takes three dimensional blocks.  the padded crop mask and the padded image is stored into a 3 dimensional array.  when CPblkproc evaluates the block, it will take information from both arrays.  
			 
(7/20)- Montage Pipeline

- (Anne 6/12/06) - It appears that pixel size is not loaded when you load old pipelines from output files. See the developer's note for info about pixel size; it's supposed to be in handles.Settings. We should probably check all instances where pixel size is used/stored and make absolutely sure it makes sense.

(7/17-7/17) Finished

- (Requested by Anne 2-22-06) - In the Load Images module, a warning msg pops up telling you your images are using less than 1/16 the available dynamic range and asks you to consider using a rescale intensity module. Before giving this suggestion, it should check handles.ModuleNames(:) to see whether you already *have* a rescale intensity module in the pipeline and if so, do not give the warning. 

(7/11-7/14) - Finished

- Anne 7-11-06: Now that you are the expert on hacking image file formats!, could you see whether it is easy to extract certain information from the DIB image file header? Right now, in CPimread we have to stop processing and ask the user a few questions: pixel height and width, number of channels, bit depth, etc., but I am pretty sure this info must be stored in the image header somewhere. I guess google probably won't help much here, but possibly you (and Ray) can figure it out?

-(7/13-7/13) Added a few lines to accomplish this

- Anne 7-5-06: When running in 'choose which windows to display mode', the "ok" button should be uppercase. Also, have OK be the default behavior, so the user can just press enter.

-(7/7-7/11) Changed function CPimread.  Added subfunction imreadZVI, reads images of .ZVI format.

- FAIRLY URGENT Anne 7-7-06: It would be great if CellProfiler could read ZVI format images. Someone has already written an open-source java-based ZVI reader:
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/zvi-reader.html so hopefully that program would help figure out the format so we can alter CPimread to handle this image type. Notice how we handle DIB format images in CPimread for an example. I put example ZVI images in the DeveloperDropBox (two files named SNAP...)

-(Mike 5/10/06) ClassifyObjects recently got the ability to annotate the bins created. Currently it is saved in handles.Measurements.Image but if two classify object modules are used the annotation and features would be overwritten. Make the heading of these annotations be descriptive like the measurements are.

(7/6/06-7/6/06)- done

(6/29/06-6/29/06) - Update DataTools/Image Tools decription for report

(6/28-6/28) Report edits in Illustrator

- Create the option to select certain display windows to open

(6/26-6/29) Added a SelectDisplayMode option in the Set Preferences window.  Display Modes are: No windows, All windows, Specify windows.  Specify windows creates a user prompt asking for which module windows to display.

- (Anne 4/21/06) Re-design the Export Data window

(6/22/06-6/23) - All revisions are marked by surrounding rows of '%'s along with comments.  
		Revisions
		-Y position gets stored by variable 'ypos'
		-Fields are arranged in 2 column form
		-Height of the window is calculated differently
		-Position of all fields have been changed

- (Anne 4/25/06) - We should add Help > Module help to the main CellProfiler window (like DataTools and ImageTools are currently set up)

(6/21/06-6/22/06)  - All revisions are marked by surrounding rows of '%'s

- (6/19-6/21) - Pipeline to make a tiled tiff

- (6/15/06-6/19/06) Combine Module - Combines up to 3 images
