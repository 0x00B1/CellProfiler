Mike's TODO list

- SBS figure for David

- SBS Data for Anne

- New images for Scott Floyd

- Check Ray's clearborder and compare with imclearborder

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.
