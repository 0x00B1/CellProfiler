Mike's TODO list

- SBS image set: Need fresh data for dose response chart for Wortmannin only (like David's ppt slide). just need the excel data. Also, need supplemental table of the Z and V factors for any measure whose Z FACTOR is above 0.5. For this, we need to make sure we have the full measure name (e.g. which compartment, etc).

- Anne 12/15 - Make sure the Compile wizard instructions are up to date now.

- (Anne 12/15) - Sometime in January, process BioImage and Vitra cytoplasm to nucleus translocation data sets and send results to Ilya for publication!

- For some reason the HelpProgrammingNotes do not scroll properly in the text display box - there is no way to scroll in small enough increments to see all the text. I think this is our longest text file so maybe that's why it behaves strangely.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- Check CalcStatistics to make sure it's processing numbers properly.

- Don't forget to put instructions for printing posters onto the wiki - the protocol there is pretty old.

- (Requested by Anne 10-31-05) - It'd be fun to see how long an image processing run takes on Matlab developer's version vs. the compiled version (which ought to be faster).  Eventually, we probably should do some real test runs (on the final version) so we can state in the paper the expected difference in speed between the two versions.
