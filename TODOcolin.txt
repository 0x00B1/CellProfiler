Colin's TODO list

- (Requested by Anne 9-21-05) - We haven't tested these modules in a *very* long time - so we should try them out & make sure they work!

Restart

- (Requested by Anne 10-25-05) - ProcessOutlines needs to be updated:  We need to rename this module IdentifyPrimBasedOnOutlines. State in the help whether the incoming image should be black background with white outlines or vice versa. We need to make this like the other Primary modules, which I think means we need to add fields like 'Edited' in the handles.Pipeline. I think we also need to produce fields in the handles.Measurements structure indicating Object count and maybe location too. See IdentifyPrimAutomatic to make this one consistent.  Doublecheck the IdentifyPrimManual to be sure it's consistent while we are at it.

- Create business cards for yourself! I've put files in Promotional > Business Cards, plus instructions for doing it. For mine, I'd like to keep the format of having WIBR-stuff on the front and CP stuff on the back. You are welcome to create CP-only cards (this is probably better because officially the WIBR doesn't like us to use their logo without getting it approved through the administration which is a pain).  I've got a word file that contains many links to the same business card file - that way you can adjust the business card file for different people or to update contact info, and then just change the link in the word file and it should all update. I bought stiff paper which apparently feeds through laser printers ok - it's on my desk. We have a laser printer in Lahra/David Sabatini's office called SABATINI COLOR you can use, but we should try to minimize how much color ink we use, so making the cards have a white background would be a good idea, and would look nice for the CP logo (for mine, with the WIBR stuff, i think we have to keep it purple background, but for practicing, I'd stick to a white background card). I'm sure we can find a paper cutter somewhere (perhaps the printing room, which i think is room 213).  The spacing of the cards on those template files may be messed up because it's designed for perforated business card paper, but that paper is kind of lame because it leaves little fuzzies on the edges of the cards so i think we are better off using plain card stock and a paper cutter.  Once you have things set up for you, I'd like one sheet of cards, and you can ask Mike & Susan if they'd like some too. Update the instructions if anything changes. I guess we could SVN commit a new card for each person?  or just store a card for each person on your local computer but leave the template untouched. whatever. have fun.  don't give yourself a fancy title.  :)  Colin Clarke, VP of UROPs.  :)
