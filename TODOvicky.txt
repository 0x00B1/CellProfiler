TODO

- (Requested by Anne 2-22-06) - In the Load Images module, a warning msg pops up telling you your images are using less than 1/16 the available dynamic range and asks you to consider using a rescale intensity module. Before giving this suggestion, it should check handles.ModuleNames(:) to see whether you already *have* a rescale intensity module in the pipeline and if so, do not give the warning. 

- Anne 7-11-06: Now that you are the expert on hacking image file formats!, could you see whether it is easy to extract certain information from the DIB image file header? Right now, in CPimread we have to stop processing and ask the user a few questions: pixel height and width, number of channels, bit depth, etc., but I am pretty sure this info must be stored in the image header somewhere. I guess google probably won't help much here, but possibly you (and Ray) can figure it out?

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)-- See 'Potential improvement' in the Histogram data tool.

- (Requested by Anne 12-09-05)- Many modules do not have corresponding images in the manual, so we should make some example images in Promotional/ImagesForManual.

DONE
- Anne 7-5-06: When running in 'choose which windows to display mode', the "ok" button should be uppercase. Also, have OK be the default behavior, so the user can just press enter.

-Changed function CPimread.  Added subfunction imreadZVI, reads images of .ZVI format.

- FAIRLY URGENT Anne 7-7-06: It would be great if CellProfiler could read ZVI format images. Someone has already written an open-source java-based ZVI reader:
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/zvi-reader.html so hopefully that program would help figure out the format so we can alter CPimread to handle this image type. Notice how we handle DIB format images in CPimread for an example. I put example ZVI images in the DeveloperDropBox (two files named SNAP...)

-(Mike 5/10/06) ClassifyObjects recently got the ability to annotate the bins created. Currently it is saved in handles.Measurements.Image but if two classify object modules are used the annotation and features would be overwritten. Make the heading of these annotations be descriptive like the measurements are.

(7/6/06-7/6/06)- done

(6/29/06-6/29/06) - Update DataTools/Image Tools decription for report

(6/28-6/28) Report edits in Illustrator

- Create the option to select certain display windows to open

(6/26-6/29) Added a SelectDisplayMode option in the Set Preferences window.  Display Modes are: No windows, All windows, Specify windows.  Specify windows creates a user prompt asking for which module windows to display.

- (Anne 4/21/06) Re-design the Export Data window

(6/22/06-6/23) - All revisions are marked by surrounding rows of '%'s along with comments.  
		Revisions
		-Y position gets stored by variable 'ypos'
		-Fields are arranged in 2 column form
		-Height of the window is calculated differently
		-Position of all fields have been changed

- (Anne 4/25/06) - We should add Help > Module help to the main CellProfiler window (like DataTools and ImageTools are currently set up)

(6/21/06-6/22/06)  - All revisions are marked by surrounding rows of '%'s

- (6/19-6/21) - Pipeline to make a tiled tiff

- (6/15/06-6/19/06) Combine Module - Combines up to 3 images
